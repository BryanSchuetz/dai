**Description**: As per the [2020 OECD State of fragility report](https://www.oecd.org/dac/states-of-fragility-fa5a6770-en.htm), the global systemic shock of COVID-19 will intensify fragility and its consequences on people, planet and prosperity. In 2020, before the outbreak of the pandemic, fragile contexts were home to an estimated 76.56% of people living in extreme poverty. An additional 26 million people are expected to fall into extreme poverty due to the impact of COVID-19 in fragile contexts.  

This session will look at solutions to tackle the issue of exacerbated fragility on informal workers, women and the youth living in fragile states and conflict affected countries and consider how private sector activities and investment can support and expedite recovery.
