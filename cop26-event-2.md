The Centre for Disaster Prevention and DAI are co-hosting [DEVEX’s “COP out” Panel](https://pages.devex.com/cop-out-or-radically-change-the-way-the-world-pays-for-disasters.html) on Tuesday 9 November. In this second week of COP26, the Panel will discussing how international and local actors can work together to create mechanisms for pre-agreed financing to ensure more timely, efficient, and agile disaster response.

Unless the system we use to pay for disasters is adapted to meet the modern challenges of today, vulnerable communities will be kept in a vicious circle of poverty, making long term development progress – including the protection of biodiversity – impossible. We already have the technology and skills to predict most disasters, yet funds are normally only sought after a disaster has already hit. In the case of nine recent disasters, just 2.3 percent of the total funding was agreed up front, despite most of the disasters having been predicted.
 
The panel will examine how international and local actors can work together to create mechanisms for pre-agreed financing to ensure more timely, efficient, and agile disaster response. Drawing on the work of the Crisis Lookout Coalition, the panel will also explore how a new global alliance for crisis protection can help identify priority risks, help people adapt, and make sure they have the funds they need when it matters most.
