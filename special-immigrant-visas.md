If you are an Afghan national who has worked directly as an employee for DAI in Afghanistan and you need an Employment Verification Letter (EVL) to apply for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) Program or need an Employer Priority-2 Designation (P-2) Referral, please fill out [this form](http://daisiv.dai.com/). DAI is now using this form and JIRA software to manage requests for SIV Employment Verification Letters and P-2 referrals. We are committed to supporting you in the application process.

## How do I apply to DAI for an SIV EVL or a Referral to the P-2 program? 

**Apply through [this form](http://daisiv.dai.com/)**. Please only fill out the form once and attach the requested documents. That will allow us to process your request for an SIV Employment Verification Letter or P-2 Referral as soon as possible. Once you receive your EVL, please follow Department of State guidelines for submission of your SIV application. DAI will directly submit your application materials for P-2 referrals. 

## Do I attach anything to the form?

## I’ve already submitted my request to SIV@dai.com. Should I fill out the webform as well?

No. If you have already emailed us, do not fill out the webform. We are receiving a high volume of requests and any duplicates will make it harder for us to respond to your first email.

## Why am I receiving emails from new email addresses? Is it safe to respond?  

DAI is now using JIRA software to manage requests for EVLs and P-2 referrals. Please respond to those emails with the requested materials. Emails from the following addresses are legitimate: SIV@dai.com, sivsupport@daisiv.net, and jira@nafjc.com.

## How do I check on the status of my request to DAI for an EVL or P-2? 

If you submit via the webform, you will be able to create an account with JIRA after receiving the first confirmation email. The status of your request will be visible upon account login.
If you submitted your request to SIV@dai.com, we will email you with any updates regarding the status of your request. 

## I’ve already submitted my SIV application to the National Visa Center. How do I check on the status?

Call the Department of State SIV Hotline: 1-888-407-4747 or 202-501-4444. The first prompt is for U.S. Citizens. Wait until it finishes the recording, then the second prompt will start. It says, “If you’re calling about Visas, press 1”.
