## How do I learn more about the U.S. visa programs?

* [Afghanistan Inquiries - Updates on SIV & P-2 programs](https://www.state.gov/afghanistan-inquiries/) – Make sure to scroll down past the updates for US Citizens. There is a section specifically dedicated to SIV and P-2 respectively.
* [Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) Guidelines U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html)
* [Priority 2 Designation (P-2) Guidelines for Refugee Admissions by U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/u-s-refugee-admissions-program-priority-2-designation-for-afghan-nationals/)
* [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program Instructions by Refugee Processing Center (RPC)](https://www.wrapsnet.org/siv-iraqi-syrian-afghan-referrals/)

## I’ve already submitted my application to SIV@dai.com and I received an auto-reply asking me to fill out the form again. Should I respond and fill it out twice?

No. If you have already filled out the form once you don’t need to fill it out again. The email you received is confirmation that we received your first email. We are receiving high volumes of applications and any duplicate emails sent can make it harder to respond to your first email.

## I’ve already submitted my SIV application to the National Visa Center. How do I check on the status?

* Call the Department of State SIV Hotline: 1-888-407-4747 or 202-501-4444. The first prompt is for U.S. Citizens. Wait until it finishes the recording, then the second prompt will start. It says, “If you’re calling about Visas, press 1”.
