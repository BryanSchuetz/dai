Steve Hawkins is a health program management and systems strengthening expert with particular strength in supply chain management. He has more than 40 years of design, implementation, evaluation, finance, policy, and management experience distributed around the globe. He has served as the Chief of Party for programs in Kenya and Ghana.

His original training as a civil engineer has provided a strong foundation in quantitative problem-solving while his broad health program experience has provided a systems-level appreciation for the roles of foundational inputs such as commodities, human resources, funding, infrastructure, and the policy environment. Steve is recognized for quantitative analysis and clear presentations of complex topics such as commodity security, restricted commodity procurement, the donor agency budget process and contractor cost structures. 

He joined DAI in April after serving for more than four years as a senior management backstop to donor programs in Uganda, Mozambique, Haiti, Ukraine, and the Vaccine Access and Delivery Initiative.
