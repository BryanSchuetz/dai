Paola Lang, Business and Program Development Advisor, joined DAI in 2003, after tours with the economic consulting firm Nathan Associates and the nonprofit PACT. She brings to DAI’s operating platform in Nigeria 15 years of extensive field work principally in Africa, as well as 18 years concentrating in developing programs, initiatives, and partnerships, often as team leader. Paola’s field work has encompassed diverse initiatives, such as launching a counterpart fund to finance agricultural growth in Guinea, building investment facilitation capacities in Cape Verde, spurring enterprise expansion in Croatia, and assisting a development bank in Bangladesh to restructure its troubled loan portfolio through turnaround plans for select corporate borrowers. Her program development work covers services contracts, larger-scale sector projects, and public-private alliances focused on supply chain, resource management, and quality-of-life improvements.
