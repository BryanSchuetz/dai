Robin Padberg is a seasoned international executive with more than 20 years of management experience. He offers a unique blend of private sector and development expertise and has spent much of his career focused on promoting growth and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and agribusiness by fostering sector linkages, building SME capacity, facilitating access to financial services, and fostering and attracting investments to drive SME and private sector growth. 

In Haiti, he oversaw numerous SME development activities, including in the agricultural sector. For example, he managed the Haiti Business Accelerator program which focused on identifying promising SMEs, assisting them in becoming investment ready, and linking them with banks and investors. During his work with the Haiti Hope public-private partnership, he worked directly with microcredit institutions to create new and innovative microcredit products for smallholder farmers and microenterprises, including the use of credit guarantees needed to attract lenders to increase agricultural-related lending. Most recently, he led the USAID-funded Local Enterprise and Value Chain Enhancement (LEVE) project, which built up enterprises through technical support and strengthened value chains in the agribusiness, apparel and textiles, and construction sectors. 

As an experienced manager, Robin has worked on large, complex projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, overseeing technical, administrative, and financial operations.
