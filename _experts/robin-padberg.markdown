With more than 20 years of international management experience, Robin Padberg has a blend of private sector and development expertise. Robin is currently Chief of Party of the [USAID Southern Africa Mobilizing Investment Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southern-africa-mobilizing-investment), which promotes inclusive economic growth and self-reliance in the region. Robin was previously the Chief of Party for the [Nguriza Nshore Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/rwanda-nguriza-nshore) in Rwanda, a project that promoted investment in small and medium enterprises in the agricultural market system. 

Prior to joining DAI, Robin worked as an independent consultant for an array of international development firms. In 2019, Robin was Chief of Party for the Local Enterprise and Value Chain Enhancement project in Haiti that increased sustainable employment by fostering dynamic value chains in agribusiness, textile and apparel, and construction. Before joining RTI International, Robin was the Country Director for TechnoServe in Haiti, managing a programmatically diverse, multi-donor, platform focusing primarily on the economic development of small firms and smallholder farmer communities with projects ranging from access to finance, agribusiness, entrepreneurship and workforce/capacity development.
