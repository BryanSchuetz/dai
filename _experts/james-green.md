For more than 30 years, Jim has worked widely in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China as a project director and rural development specialist. Jim has worked closely with all the major donor agencies, including the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. His recent experience includes overseeing land programmes in Mozambique and Rwanda, and the Global DFID Livelihoods Resource Programme. He also coordinates DAI's Land Governance Team for business development and technical inputs on projects.

He started his career as a DFID young professional and was posted to Nepal as an agronomist on a research station in the Eastern Hills. After joining Hunting Technical Services in 1985 he worked in Indonesia on a DFID-funded irrigation project. He spent the next 10 years on long-term rural development assignments in Bhutan and Bangladesh.

In 1995, James returned to Hunting's successor company, HTSPE, to head the Asia Division, responsible for business development and programme management in the region, in addition to his technical work as a rural development specialist. He has worked extensively in South Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam), the Former Soviet Union (Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Russia,) and China.

More recently, he has concentrated on managing large land programmes in Mozambique and Rwanda, as well as supporting the DFID Climate Environment Infrastructure and Livelihoods Project. His technical interests include Asian agriculture, with an emphasis on Himalayan systems.
