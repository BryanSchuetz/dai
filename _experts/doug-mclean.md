Responsible for identifying and developing strategic partnerships that support the growth of DAI’s global business, Doug builds bridges between DAI and various organizations—large and small—interested in collaborating to address the challenges faced by people around the world.

Doug manages DAI’s *Innovation into Action Challenge* program and our smart cities initiative. Over his 30-year career, he has established and managed private and public sector consulting and training programs for microfinance institutions, banks, credit unions, finance companies, and small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging economies. He has designed and managed numerous industry, association, and institutional development programs, and provided direct assistance to small, medium-sized, and large industries interested in expanding local procurement via linkages and export opportunities. He has managed five multiyear projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Prior to joining DAI, Doug served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Lesotho, worked for the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Malawi, and served as Deputy Director of CARE International’s small enterprise unit.
