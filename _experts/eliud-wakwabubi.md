Eliud Wakwabubi provides technical and strategic oversight for integrating economic strengthening approaches into HIV and AIDS programming under the regional project, ROADS II (Regional Outreach Addressing AIDS through Development Strategies), primed by FHI 360, across eastern and southern Africa. Eliud specializes in economic strengthening activities, focusing on increasing household food production, building savings and access to credit and other financial services, and linking affected households to business activities to enhance food and economic security of participating households and communities. He has expertise in designing community-managed development services targeting diverse, poor, and vulnerable groups. He is skilled and experienced in designing and applying participatory approaches in development programs for improved pro-poor relevance, governance and accountability, civil society strengthening, and citizen engagement.

> "I got interested in the development sector when I realized there was outright exclusion of the very people the sector is supposed to target. My primary role was to better understand, critique, and advance participatory innovations and methods, placing the voices, needs, and rights of poor people at the center." â€” Eliud Wakwabubi

Before joining DAI, Eliud worked for Participatory Methodologies Forum of Kenya (PAMFORK); as a Network Coordinator. He ensured that PAMFORK remained a broad-based network of participation serving as a forum for experience sharing, learning and policy advocacy in order to deepen understanding and use of participatory methods, principles, and ethics in development processes.
