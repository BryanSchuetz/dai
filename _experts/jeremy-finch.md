Jeremy Finch is the Senior Director for Investigations in DAI's Global Ethics and Integrity team.

Jeremy joined DAI in 2015 as Director of UK Internal Audit, with responsibility for regulating the control environment for the Business Unit and its complex network across the project portfolio. In 2016, he took on the role of Ethics and Compliance Officer for the UK and European Business Unit, regulating and monitoring DAI’s formidable ethics policy and exemplary code of business conduct. He joined DAI after 25 years of experience auditing a number of pan-European businesses across the leisure sector, running an internal audit function for three medium-sized private-equity-backed leisure operators.

Those businesses include the gym chain LA Fitness—now part of Pure Gym (the UK’s largest gym chain with over 1.5m members); Nuffield Health Wellbeing division—the United Kingdom’s largest not-for-profit health care provider and one of the largest five charities in the United Kingdom; and Vardon plc, now Merlin Entertainments, and second to Disney in the global visitor attraction market.

He finds the ongoing daily challenges of Ethics and Integrity in the development sector fascinating, working in vastly diverse nations across frontiers in pursuit of project success and with an ever-watchful eye on transparency and accountability. The sense of mission-driven focus that is promoted by the Code of Conduct and the wider Ethics and Integrity Programme further complements his enjoyment of working at DAI.
