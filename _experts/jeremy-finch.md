"Jeremy Finch heads up the internal audit, ethics, and compliance functions for DAI Europe. As such, he is the custodian of the control environment for the company and its complex network across the project portfolio as well as being the liaison for DAI Europe's formidable ethics policy and exemplary code of business conduct. With 25 years of experience auditing a number of pan-European businesses across the leisure sector, he has run an internal audit function for three medium-sized private-equity backed leisure operators.

Those businesses include the gym chain LA Fitness—now part of Pure Gym; Nuffield Health Wellbeing division—the UK's largest not-for-profit health care provider and one of the largest five charities in the UK; and Vardon plc, now Merlin Entertainments, and second to Disney in the visitor attraction market.

Since he started working in the development sector, he has found it as fascinating as it is challenging, working in vastly diverse nations across frontiers in pursuit of project success and with an ever-watchful eye on transparency and accountability."
