Felix Edwards, a project director and international education and governance specialist with 30 years of experience, has worked in more than 40 countries. He specializes in large bilateral education programs that deliver lasting improvements to foundational learning through systems strengthening, teacher development, and curriculum reform.

Felix started his career as a teacher before going on to manage education programs of increasing size. He joined DAI in 2022, having worked for several U.K.-based education technical advisory firms, as well as a range of nongovernmental organizations specializing in international education. He has won and delivered several multimillion-pound donor-funded development projects in education and was the Project Director for the U.K. Department for International Development’s largest global education investment, a £400-million project in Pakistan.

He brings to DAI a wealth of governance expertise. Felix worked for the National Democratic Institute for six years in Malawi and Washington, D.C., supporting democracy projects particularly in Southern Africa. More recently, he managed a team advising the central government in South Sudan as it transitioned into an independent state.
