The schoolyards of Queens, New York, where Paul Hartman grew up, are a long way from the jungles of Borneo. But that's the journey Paul made when he moved to Indonesia in 2001, eventually to run an orangutan conservation program for DAI.

Paul became fascinated by the interaction between communities and their natural environment during his first trip into Borneo's spectacular tropical forests. The indigenous Dayak community that was Paul's eventual stopping point was comprised of villagers whose families were forest nomads just 30 years earlier. Animism and the interaction between the physical and spiritual world continued to permeate the belief system of the village, steering their use of natural resources.

> "What would the loss of the orangutan tell us about ourselves? If we are unable to take the steps to save orangutans—one of our closest animal relatives—will the die be cast for our ability to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable people survive the impact of global climate change?" — Paul Hartman

Paul has since spent more than a decade in Southeast Asia overseeing natural resources management projects focused on climate change adaptation, sustainable forestry, and biodiversity conservation. He has led three U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded projects, including currently as Chief of Party on the Bangkok-based Mekong Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change project (Mekong ARCC). Mekong ARCC focuses on identifying the environmental, economic and social effects of climate change in the Lower Mekong Basin, and on assisting highly exposed and vulnerable rural populations in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao increase their ability to adapt to climate change impacts on water resources, agricultural systems, biodiversity, ecosystems, and livelihood options.
