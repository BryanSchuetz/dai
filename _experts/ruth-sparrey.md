She brings more than 25 years of experience as a rural development consultant and project director, working with community-based and nongovernmental organisations, and with governments to manage innovative livelihood initiatives targeted at households, farms, and communities. She has overseen and managed a wide range of projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, the Sahel, South Sudan, eSwatini, and Thailand for a range of clients, including the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, the European Union, the World Food Programme, GIZ, and the Capacity Building Trust Fund. 

At DAI, Ruth has held programme management responsibility for [Evidence on Demand](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-evidence-demand-core-services), a knowledge service that covered climate, environment, infrastructure, and livelihoods themes, and was responsible for the Expert Advisory Call Down Service for Resilience and Strengthening Response to Crisis managed by DAI. 

She has provided technical support to DFIDâ€™s Programme of Advisory Support Services and managed the Livelihood Resource Centre, covering core services and framework contracts and co-led the initiative to include climate thinking in the support provided.
