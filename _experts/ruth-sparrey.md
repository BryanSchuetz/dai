She held program management responsibility for [Evidence on Demand](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-evidence-demand-core-services), a knowledge service that covered climate, environment, infrastructure, and livelihoods themes and was responsible for the [Expert Advisory Call Down Service for Resilience and Strengthening Response to Crisis](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-eacds) managed by DAI. Ruth has more than 25 plus of experience as a rural development consultant and as a project director on donor-funded projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, the Sahel, South Sudan, eSwatini, and Thailand, for the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, the European Union, the World Food Programme, GIZ, and the Capacity Building Trust Fund. Ruth provided technical support to the Programme of Advisory Support Services and managed the Livelihood Resource Centre, covering core services and framework contracts. She has worked directly with community-based organisations, nongovernmental organisations, and government agencies to manage innovative livelihood initiatives targeted at household, farm, and community levels.
