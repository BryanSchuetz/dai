While raised throughout her youth in the French countryside, Gaelle Le Pottier early on started her career as itinerant experience sampler, working first with mostly with Somali refugees in the early 1990s in Kenya and Somalia, deciding then that development “was not for her” (after witnessing firsthand the genesis and cause of what would become the “Do No Harm” approach), moving on to fall head over heels in love with post-civil war Lebanon.

There, Gaelle become all absorbed by a culture and country which would become her home for the following decade, teaching history of the Middle East in Beirut, completing her oral-history based Masters thesis focused on the history of the pre-civil war student movement at the American University of Beirut and finally becoming a full-time researcher focused on Lebanese trans-national flows.

After joining the corporate banking world for a couple years, Gaelle decided that it was time to return to “interesting work” delving back this time into governance-related development going from Iraq, to South Sudan, Ecuador, DR of Congo, Yemen and back to Kenya/Somalia.

Step by step, it became quickly apparent that her natural leaning was mostly in areas “least fun” for most living souls (i.e. monitoring and evaluation, management, accountability, systems, compliance) while remaining engaged with projects of greatest technical interest (governance at large, sustainable tourism, and now countering violent extremism). 

Gaelle is today a six-time Chief for Party / Team Leader.
