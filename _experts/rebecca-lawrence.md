Since 1996, Rebecca Lawrence has planned and implemented more than a dozen large-scale development programs, and contributed to the design or management of at least 20 others. She has more than 15 years of experience in democracy, governance, and stabilization programs in Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Zimbabwe), Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan), the Balkans, the former Soviet Union, and the Middle East. These programs have encompassed good governance, civil society development, conflict mitigation, and municipal services and infrastructure.

Rebecca currently directs the U.K. Department for International Development's Mozambique Democratic Governance Support Program, which aims to build voice and accountability in urban municipalities. Previously, she managed DAI's cross-cutting teams implementing stabilization and state-building programs for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in East Africa, and was project team leader for more than $65 million in USAID-funded programs in Pakistan. She has also worked on DAI's business development team and chaired its Haiti working group.

> "There are many pieces to every puzzle, and the best projects address a development problem in an integrated way. We take a holistic view to the people and the place, and see the politics, the economy, the environmental, water, or land issues at stake." â€” Rebecca Lawrence

In 12 years with the Urban Institute's International Activities Center, Rebecca served as a team leader in the field and home office, working on the development, implementation, research, and assessment of USAID and World Bank local government, decentralization, housing, and urban development programs.

"I like it when things are difficult," said Rebecca of her international assignments. "Most of the work related to stability and weak governance happens to be in the most volatile regions of the world. I don't shy away from working in the tough places, to try to bring decent services and government to people living with conflict, natural disasters, extreme poverty, and corruption."
