After ditching plans to become a lawyer, William Thompson, via the Peace Corps and other organizations, found himself teaching math in Fiji and training Afghan teachers along the Afghan/Pakistan border, long before the current conflict. He then ran programs for the International Rescue Committee in Pakistan, Thailand, and Georgia, before joining Save the Children for six years of assignments in Bhutan, Nepal, along with a brief assignment in Kosovo. William served four years as UNICEF's state representative in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, India.

>"I was the first student from my university to join the Peace Corps and I had to overcome a great deal of skepticism on the part of my peers and family, but it was the most profound, meaningful and significant professional decision I ever made." — William Thompson

He returned to the United States and worked from 2005-2007 as manager of international affairs for the AIDS Project Los Angeles. From February 2007 until September 2011, William led development projects in Afghanistan, first as country director for Relief International and FLAG International, and since September 2008 as director, deputy chief of party, and chief of party for the DAI-led Local Governance and Community Development project, the flagship governance project in Afghanistan of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Most recently he headed up the Jordan Workforce Development Project.
