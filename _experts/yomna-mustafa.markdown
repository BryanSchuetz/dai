Yomna Mustafa is the Chief of Party for [Business Egypt](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/egypt-business-egypt), a U.S. Agency for International Development-funded program that aims to substantially increase sales revenues and investments among Egyptian micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, creating new job opportunities, especially for women and youth.

Yomna is an Egyptian private sector development specialist and program director with more than 20 years of experience supporting SME growth and the business enabling environment, and managing and implementing big projects with complex outcomes and market dynamics across the MENA region for diverse donors, including for USAID. As Program Manager for the USAID/Jordan Achievement of Market Friendly Initiatives and Results (AMIR), she drove AMIR’s growth from a $13 million dollar, fixed-price contract to a $74 million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, and recruited and managed 64 field-based employees and all short-term consultants and home office support staff. As Program Director for USAID/Egypt’s Technical Assistance to Support Economic Policy Reform (TAPR), a $13 million complex IQC with seven technical components focused on strengthening the private sector, she managed a team of 13 technical, finance, operations and administrative staff, oversaw all technical, financial and management activities on the project, and supported several short-term technical assignments. Ms. Mustafa served for six years as Egypt Country Director for the Former Commonwealth Development Office (FDCO)- and Islamic Development Bank-funded Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund (AWEF), a 10 million British Pounds Market Systems Development program that applies a Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) lens to economically empower disadvantaged women in Egypt, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).
Led by Ms. Mustafa, AWEF successfully engaged the Egyptian private sector to improve the access and agency of women through program interventions in Egypt’s ready-made-garments (RMG), digital financial services and food processing sectors. She has established relationships with key digital financial service providers to improve financial literacy for women and support women-owned microbusinesses across sectors, including the rollout of e-payment services to 100,027 female microfinance clients across Egypt. 
With a background in financial services and SME lending, she has served a both Country Director and Senior Advisor to the Financial Services Volunteers Corps (FSVC), overseeing both business development and program implementation in Libya and Yemen, and collaborating with banks and key market actors in the region to promote SME lending, with a primary focus on women.
