Yomna Mustafa is the Chief of Party for [Business Egypt](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/egypt-business-egypt), a U.S. Agency for International Development-funded program that aims to increase revenues and investments among Egyptian micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), creating new job opportunities, especially for women and young people.

Yomna is an Egyptian private sector development specialist and program director with more than 20 years of experience supporting MSME growth and the business-enabling environment. She was Program Director for the [Technical Assistance to Support Economic Policy Reform (TAPR)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/egypt-technical-assistance-policy-reform-ii-tapr-ii) project and Egypt Country Director for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FDCO)- and Islamic Development Bank-funded [Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund (AWEF)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/jordan-egypt-and-palestine-arab-women-enterprise-fund), a market systems development program that applied a women’s economic empowerment lens to economically empower disadvantaged women in Egypt, Jordan, and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

Led by Yomna, AWEF successfully engaged the Egyptian private sector to improve the access and agency of women through program interventions in Egypt’s ready-made garments, digital financial services, and food processing sectors. 
 
With a background in financial services and MSME lending, she has served as both a Country Director and Senior Advisor to the Financial Services Volunteers Corps, overseeing both business development and program implementation in Libya and Yemen, and collaborating with banks and key market actors in the region to promote MSME lending, with a primary focus on women.
