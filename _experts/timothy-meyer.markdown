Timothy Meyer has worked at the nexus of law and development for more than a decade. After obtaining his law degree, he worked in Liberia on various justice reform and access of to justice programs, including an initiative that sought to counter prolonged pre-trial detention through support to civil society organizations, special judicial hearing bodies convened at the Monrovia Central Prison and support to the Liberian Solicitor General to convene pre-trial detention working groups. Timothy also worked on an access to justice program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in Liberia that supported customary chiefs and community paralegals to expand their knowledge of the law and access to legal assistance and dispute resolution.
 
In 2019, Timothy applied this experience while serving as Deputy Chief of Party and legal advisor on a USAID program in Somalia that sought to expand access to justice through collaboration with civil society organizations to introduce a novel community paralegal program adapted to help individuals navigate justice pathways in Somalia’s plural justice environment.
 
Timothy has led, managed, and developed programming focused on access to justice, human rights documentation, and legislative reform in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Eswatini, Jordan, Niger, Mali, and Somalia. At DAI, Timothy supports the Security, Transparency, Accountability, and Rule of Law practice under the Governance Sector. In this role, Timothy is supporting business development, knowledge capture, and technical implementation around access to justice, with an emphasis on people-centered justice approaches.
 
Timothy is a lawyer barred in Illinois and also served as a women’s education and empowerment volunteer in the U.S. Peace Corps in Togo.
