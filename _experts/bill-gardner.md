Bill Gardner has been working in development for more than 30 years, specializing in effective tax policies, tax administration systems, and financial management systems for economies in transition.

He has previously served as Chief of Party on projects in Armenia, Egypt, and Kyrgyzstan. Under his direction, each of these projects achieved significant successesâ€”the development, enactment, and implementation of the first comprehensive new tax code established through a democratic legislative process in Kyrgyzstan; the complete structuring of the Armenian tax administration system in concert with the development of an automated tax system; and the implementation of an integrated Model Tax and Customs Center in Egypt that led the way to future integration of the Sales Tax and Income Tax Departments.

Prior to his work on development projects, Bill held a number of roles in local government affairs including as an economist on the revenue estimating staff of the Joint Committee of Taxation of the U.S. Congress and in the Office of Revenue Estimating and Economic Analysis of the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet.
