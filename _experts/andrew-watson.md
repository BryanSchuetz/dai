As a graduate student in geomorphology, Andrew Watson worked on desert soils in Tunisia and Namibia. Over the past 30 years, his technical focus has shifted from the earth sciences and remote sensing to environment policy and impact assessment, natural resource management, and biodiversity conservation, and, most recently, to climate change adaptation, with an emphasis on the sustainable use of water resources. Andrew has worked in diverse natural environments, from the tropical rain forests of Indonesia, Madagascar, Bolivia, and Brazil, to the deserts of Namibia and Saudi Arabia.

> "Initiatives that focus on fixing problems rather than building on existing assets rarely succeed. For me, good development is about helping people realize the full value of their own resources—knowledge and natural capital, as well as the will and commitment to strive for a better life."

In his 18 years with DAI, Andrew has undertaken three long-term assignments—in Madagascar, Malawi, and [Morocco][3]. Most recently, he was Chief of Party on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [Morocco Economic Competitiveness][4] program, a four-year initiative that promoted trade and created jobs for youth by improving agricultural production and agroprocessing. From 1999 to 2003, Andrew was based in Malawi, where he managed USAID's Community Partnerships for Sustainable Resource Management (COMPASS) activity. COMPASS supported community-based natural resource management in the forestry, fisheries, and wildlife sectors. Earlier, Andrew spent three years in Madagascar, where he helped build institutional capacity to regulate natural resource conservation and to use and assess the impact of proposed development projects. From 2003 to 2010, Andrew was the Managing Director of DAI's Environment and Energy sector. From 2007 to 2011, he sat on the DAI Board of Directors.
