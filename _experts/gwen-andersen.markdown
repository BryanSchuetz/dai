Gwen Andersen’s interest in renewable energy came from being impressed by the tremendous difference even a small amount of electricity can make in every field, be it education, health, security, or income generation, and being a gadget queen. 

When she entered the field more than 20 years ago, renewable energy was expensive and only appropriate for rural areas that lacked steady access to fuel and maintenance expertise. As prices for renewable energy plunged she moved to utility scale renewable energy. She managed the turnaround of a renewable energy center that focused on community ownership so that the community received as much of the economic benefit from the plants as possible. Since then she has been working to increase the speed with which developing countries adopt renewable energy by working on finance.

> “The success of renewable energy has never been about the technology. It has been about the institutional environment. Originally success depended on developing cost recovery mechanisms and training local people to be able to take care of the system. Now it depends on the enabling environment that allows it to fairly compete with fossil fuels.” 

Her focus is on wind, solar, and small hydro but she gained familiarity with biomass at the renewable energy center and when managing a feasibility study for a 50-megawatt power plant at a cement factory in rural Pakistan. Her work has moved from writing a guidebook for rural electrification and teaching safe installation of solar home systems to presentations to policy makers and businesses on investing in renewable energy and leading the first formal education program on the finance and economic aspects of renewable energy, online, through the School of Business of Saint Francis University. Since then she has trained at the U.S. Agency for International Development and financial institutions in Central American in renewable energy technology. At DAI she helps maximize the synergies between energy and economic growth, agriculture, and health.
