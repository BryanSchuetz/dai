Paul has 22 years of experience leading international development programs in Asia, Africa, and the Balkans. He currently oversees a portfolio of USAID-funded environment projects in Southeast Asia.

Prior to his current role, Paul was the DAI Chief of Party for the [USAID Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-apik-adaptasi-perubahan-iklim-dan-ketangguhan-or-climate-change-adaption) (APIK) project in Indonesia, which ended in June 2020. APIK focused on mainstreaming climate and disaster resilience into government of Indonesia frameworks, building the capacity of communities and the private sector to address climate and weather-related hazards, and improving the quality and accessibility of climate and weather information services.

Before joining DAI, Paul worked for Mercy Corps for 12 years, including six years as Country Director in Indonesia and Timor-Leste. In these roles, Paul led large teams and a diverse portfolio of programs, including those focused on climate and disaster resilience, market development, private sector engagement, and health. Paul is fluent in Bahasa Indonesia.
