Prior to his current role as Chief of Party of KIWASH, Joe was the Chief of Party for a Feed the Future agricultural project in Zimbabwe, where he led a comprehensive approach that assisted more than 150,000 smallholder farmersâ€™ integration into productive value chains, resulting in an average per-household increase from $483 to $1,735 per annum. Earlier in Nepal, Joe directed a rural development project that benefitted more than 950,000 people and resulted in a 400 percent increase in annual incomes for 13,000 farmers. In Bolivia, he directed two USAID programs that supported the economic and social development of 55,000 rural households that were dependent on illicit coca production; overseeing a $34 million grants portfolio that constructed 325 infrastructure projects, raised annual incomes by a collective $14 million, generated 11,200 full-time jobs, and facilitated 21,600 hectares of licit agricultural production.
