Joe Sanders has 18 years of experience, including more than 10 years of full-time management experience on projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Prior to KIWASH, Joe was the Chief of Party for a Feed the Future agricultural project in Zimbabwe, where he led a comprehensive approach that assisted more than 150,000 smallholder farmers to increase incomes, resulting in an average per-household increase from $483 to $1,735 per annum. Earlier in Nepal, Joe directed a rural development project that benefitted more than 950,000 people and resulted in a 400 percent increase in annual incomes for 13,000 farmers. In Bolivia, he directed two USAID programs with substantial water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infrastructure activities, overseeing a $16 million in infrastructure funds to support improved service delivery by decentralized government institutions. In Afghanistan, he oversaw field operations for a four-year activity directed at the rehabilitation of large-scale irrigation and rural roads systems.
