Enrique Giraldo has more than 20 years of experience in tax policy and administration, demonstrated management credentials in leading U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) projects, and established credibility with Salvadoran counterparts. He was formerly Chief of Party of the El Salvador Tax Policy and Administration Reform Project and the Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management Program for DAI, when he [successfully assisted](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/long-term-fiscal-reform-takes-root-in-el-salvador-and-elsewhere/) in the modernization of El Salvador's national tax administration providing the necessary structure to more efficiently support tax compliance through improved taxpayer services, a modernized IT infrastructure, an aggressive pursuit of fraud and corruption, and improved tax policy analysis, helping the taxing authority gain both accountability and legitimacy.

Enrique has led the design and implementation of tax policy and administrative reforms throughout Latin America. His work has included serving as a Tax Consultant for the U.S. Department of Treasury in Paraguay and Honduras, analyzing tax codes, making recommendations to strengthen enforcement and auditing, and drafting transfer pricing legislation. He also consulted on the USAID/DAI Ecuador Strengthening Access to Microfinance and Economic Liberalization Task Order, advising on the restructuring of the Servicio de Rentas Internas.

Prior to consulting, he held senior positions in the Colombian Customs and Excise Administration, and in the Colombian Social Security Agency. He was a professor of macroeconomics at the Universidad Externo de Colombia and the Universidad Sergio Arboleda.
