William brings more than 30 years of experience to the challenges of business competitiveness, enterprise development, business enabling environment, investment facility design, and public-private dialogue. He has worked in dozens of countries on various assignmentsâ€”ranging from writing a franchise plan for 330 health clinics to designing a regional venture capital project to assessing policy and regulatory constraints to private sector growth to carrying out a risk assessment as part of an analysis for a loan portfolio guarantee program.

Before joining DAI, he worked for Deloitte Consulting, Booz Allen Hamilton, Chemonics International, and as a freelance consultant. He has worked long-term in the Caribbean on an agribusiness venture capital initiative, in Uganda serving as an agribusiness advisor on a nontraditional export project, and in Kenya working a mixed portfolio of initiatives including agriculture, water and sanitation, youth leadership, and business development.

As Managing Director for Economic Growth at DAI, he leads a diverse team of professionals in financial services, agriculture/agribusiness growth, and private sector development who are responding to the challenges of shaping a more livable world.
