After graduating from McGill University with an MBA in international finance, Joanna Ledgerwood took the expected path and joined one of Canada's largest banks. Six years later she found herself in the private banking department supporting wealthy clients to manage their portfolios. At the same time, she was taking night classes in women's studies learning about the inequities of poor women around the world. Finding this very hard to reconcile with her day job, she eventually quit banking and dedicated herself to development finance.

> "By definition, people who are poor do not have the safety nets that less poor people have. Having access to a small amount of savings or credit in times of need can greatly support people's ability to cope and prevent an emergency from becoming a long-term problem. I think it is essential for development practitioners to really understand who poor people are and how they manage financially, and with that understanding, work to facilitate ways to improve their quality of life." â€” Joanna Ledgerwood

At the time, 1994, microcredit was just beginning and within a year, Joanna found herself sitting with Mohammed Yunus in Bangladesh discussing how financial services can help poor women lift themselves out of poverty. Leaving the ivory tower of banking behind, Joanna found her passion sitting in rural villages talking to women about how they juggle many competing demands with very few resources. At a time when most practitioners were anthropologists and aid workers, Joanna's banking skills provided a much-needed connection with the fundamentals of finance. After working with a number of organizations in Asia and Africa, she joined the Sustainable Banking for the Poor project at the World Bank and in 1998, wrote the _Microfinance Handbook_. She then moved to the Philippines to work with rural banks to deepen their outreach to the poor, followed by six years in Uganda working with nongovernmental organizations transforming to deposit-taking institutions. In 2006 Joanna joined the Aga Khan Foundation and led its access to finance activities until May 2013 when she joined DAI. She has continued to write, including _Transforming MFIs_ with Victoria White in 2006 and the _New Microfinance Handbook_ in 2013, both published by the World Bank.
