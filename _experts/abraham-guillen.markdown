Abraham Guillen is a leading sustainable forestry management expert with more than 35 years of experience in sustainable forestry management with a demonstrated track record of building capacity and forging partnerships between the private sector, government, communities, and civil society to achieve sustainable outcomes. Abraham’s portfolio includes managing forestry, forest governance, natural resource management, livelihoods, and resource rights projects for donors.

Abraham currently serves in Vietnam as the Chief of Party of the [Sustainable Forest Management Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/vietnam-sustainable-forest-management-activity-sfm) aimed at reducing carbon emissions by promoting sustainable practices in community forestry, wood and non-timber forest product value chains, forest policy and law enforcement, and Carbon Payment for Environment Services (C-FES) and Payment for Forest Environment Services (PFES) in seven provinces of Vietnam.

Mr. Guillen is an expert in forestry certification under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and forest licensing under FLEGT, promoted by the EU, and has experience operating in areas of community conflict over land rights, including Afghanistan and Colombia, where he developed market linkages for agricultural and forestry value chains.

Prior to the Vietnam position,  Abraham served as Team Leader of the DFID-funded Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade Action Plan (FLEGT) Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) Support Unit in Liberia, where he strengthened the capacity of government and civil society stakeholders to promote sustainable forestry, facilitate trade, and develop systems needed to control, verify, and license legal timber. He led the transition of the VPA Secretariat to the Forest Development Authority (FDA), and leveraged an additional, unprecedented $1 million grant from the Government of Liberia (GOL) for the VPA process.
