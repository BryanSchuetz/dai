Nate Bourns works across all DAI business units and corporate offices to build a next-generation operating model, beginning with key geographies such as India and Nigeria. 

Previously, Nate served as Vice President of Technical Services for DAI Europe, with overall responsibility for DAI’s Europe-based technical practices and for business development with U.K. Government customers including the Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 

An avid student of digital technology and strategy execution, currently based in London, Nate has set up and led field projects, operating groups, and technical teams across all of DAI’s major market segments, and he has played key leadership roles in establishing in-country offices, integrating acquired companies, and executing corporate-wide strategic initiatives.

Nate—who is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese—helped develop and implement DAI’s portfolio of microfinance and enterprise development projects with the U.S. Agency for International Development and public and private sector clients in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and elsewhere in Latin America, including leading early work DAI delivered in digital finance in the region.
