With a strong foundation as an actuary and economist, Daniel brings over 20 years of experience developing innovative risk finance solutions.

How Planning Ahead Will Make a Difference, co-authored with Stefan Dercon, is considered a seminal work in the field. He holds a first-class degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Cambridge University and a D.Phil. in Economics from the University of Oxford, where his dissertation focused on insurance design for developing countries.
