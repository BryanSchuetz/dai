In her former role, she brought a mix of business development, project management, and technical expertise for CDA client projects, including leading all project management and operations functions for CDA’s [13-country survey study](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration-solutions/msme-study) on micro-, small, and medium enterprises and digital tool use amidst the COVID-10 pandemic, in partnership with Meta and Ipsos.

Prior to joining DAI, Grace held a number of business development and project management roles for global health projects, with cross-cutting experience in leadership training and development, business process improvement, and operations management. She was previously a senior manager at Chemonics International, where she collaborated extensively with executive-level senior management to identify, research, strategize, and advise on pursuing business development opportunities and determining key insights by combining research and analysis with critical business drivers. She concurrently served on the activity core management team for a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program focused on delivering research, knowledge, and training products to USAID’s Acquisition and Assistance workforce.
