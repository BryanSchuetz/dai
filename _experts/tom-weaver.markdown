Before joining DAI, Tom Weaver provided technical, economic, and management advice on agriculture and livestock production, health and supply to governments, development agencies, research institutes, and private sector interests. He has worked on livestock development and One Health projects in the Asia-Pacific region for more than 12 years, including roles with projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank Group, United Nations agencies, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the European Union, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, and others. Tom has a multidisciplinary background with expertise in epidemiology, livestock production and health, value chain analysis and development, risk analysis, food safety, and data science. 

Tom’s interest in combatting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) began with his work with poultry value chains in Vietnam and Thailand. As an element of his doctoral research, he investigated the resistance types, mechanisms, and the ecology of a multidrug-resistant Salmonella strain in Australian pig herds. Tom has since supported the design of an AMR and antimicrobial use monitoring system for production animals for the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and has successfully advocated for the inclusion of AMR containment and improved antimicrobial stewardship in various ADB strategies and investment projects.
