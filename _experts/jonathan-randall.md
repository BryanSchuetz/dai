Jonathan Randall has more than 22 years of international experience managing teams and providing expertise at the intersection of sustainable development, climate change, and natural resources for organizations, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), World Bank, and World Wildlife Fund.

Jonathan specializes in the design and implementation of international development programs, strategic planning, and contract management with specific technical skills in communications, training, facilitation, climate change, biodiversity conservation, environmental policy, water resources, infrastructure, environmental and social safeguards, and knowledge management.

He has worked both internationally and domestically with experience managing diverse teams in Guatemala, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya, Zambia, Micronesia, Mozambique, Namibia, and United States. His leadership on the Green Recovery and Reconstruction Training program earned the Green Star Award from the United Nations Environment Programme, and he received the MCC CEO Award for developing the agency’s Knowledge and Innovation Network.

Originally trained as an ecologist, Jonathan’s career path was sparked while conducting biological field surveys in the Mojave Desert. Jonathan’s work supported environmentally sound economic development and the protection of unique ecosystems through an innovative public-private partnership between the U.S. government, private sector power developers, and civil society groups. In addition to developing a deep appreciation for how natural systems adapt to extreme climate conditions, Jonathan was inspired to follow a career finding solutions to complex environmental and economic issues.

Since that time, Jonathan has managed and contributed to the development of a number of successful initiatives including USAID’s climate change adaptation plan, the Executive Order on Climate Resilient International Development, Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, World Wildlife Fund-American Red Cross Partnership, HSBC Freshwater Adaption program, and Nepal freshwater biodiversity program. 

In addition to strengths in client management and project delivery, Jonathan has facilitated multiple processes for organizational development, team-building and co-creation, such as the creation of the multi-stakeholder Karnali River Basin Conservation Fund. He launched DAI’s Nature Connections quarterly e-newsletter that is distributed to more than 12,000 subscribers and has led numerous communications, knowledge management, and training activities, including multi-day workshops, speaker events, briefers, reports, videos, and capacity-building programs.

Through his work on natural disaster recovery earlier in his career, Jonathan responded to multiple floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. These include the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Cyclone Jokwe in Mozambique, Hurricane Katrina in the United States, Nepal Ghorka Earthquake, and Typhoons in Micronesia. For communities recovering from disaster, Jonathan has provided support for environmentally sound rebuilding strategies that increase community resilience and support the concept of “build back better.”
