Jonathan Randall has been working at the intersection of sustainable economic development, climate change, and environmental conservation for more than 17 years with experience in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Maldives, Micronesia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Kenya, United States and Zambia.

Originally trained as an ecologist, Jonathan’s career path was sparked while conducting biological field surveys in the Mojave Desert. Jonathan’s work supported environmentally sound economic development and the protection of unique desert landscapes by informing an innovative public-private partnership between the U.S. government, private sector power developers, and civil society groups. In addition to developing a deep appreciation for how natural systems adapt to extreme climate conditions, Jonathan was inspired to follow a career finding solutions to complex environmental and economic issues.

Since that time, Jonathan has managed and contributed to the development of a number of successful initiatives including the U.S. Agency for International Development’s climate change adaptation plan, the Executive Order on Climate Resilient International Development, Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, World Wildlife Fund-American Red Cross Partnership, HSBC Freshwater Adaption program, Nepal freshwater biodiversity program, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s Green Prosperity program.

Through his work on natural disaster recovery, Jonathan has responded to multiple floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. These include the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Cyclone Jokwe in Mozambique, Hurricane Katrina in the United States, Nepal Ghorka Earthquake, and Typhoons Pongsona and Chata’an in Micronesia. For communities recovering from disaster, Jonathan has provided support for environmentally sound rebuilding strategies that increase community resilience and support the concept of “build back better.” 

Jonathan conceptualized and managed the Green Recovery and Reconstruction Toolkit for Humanitarian Aid which was awarded the Green Star Award by United Nations Environment Program, UNOCHA, and the Green Cross in 2013. He is also the co-author of the World Bank-funded publication, “Natural Security: Protected Areas and Hazard Mitigation,” which was launched at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties.

As DAI’s Global Practice Leader for Environment, and Climate Change, Jonathan leads business development, technical assistance, and project management with a focus on climate change, environment, natural resource management, and water resources.
