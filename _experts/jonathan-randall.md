Jonathan Randall has been working at the intersection of sustainable economic development, climate change, and environmental conservation for more than 14 years with experience in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Maldives, Micronesia, Mozambique, Namibia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and United States.

Trained as an ecologist, Jonathan's career path started as an undergraduate while he was conducting ecological field surveys in the hot sun and stunning landscapes of the Mojave Desert. His field site was located on public land owned by the federal government and the project was funded by geothermal power developers as an environmental offsets project.  Witnessing the competing interests of the government, the private sector, local communities and the environment on this land in the Mojave inspired him to follow a career finding solutions to complex problems at the intersection of environment and sustainable development.

Since that time, Jonathan has managed and contributed to the development of a number of successful initiatives including the U.S. Agency for International Development's climate change adaptation plan, the Executive Order on Climate Resilient International Development, Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, World Wildlife Fund-American Red Cross Partnership, HSBC Freshwater Adaption program, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation's Green Prosperity program.

Through his work on natural disaster recovery, Jonathan has responded to multiple floods, hurricanes, and wildfires including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Cyclone Jokwe in Mozambique, Hurricane Katrina in the United States, and Typhoons Pongsona and Chata'an in Micronesia. Jonathan conceptualized and managed the Green Recovery and Reconstruction Toolkit for Humanitarian Aid which was awarded the Green Star Award by United Nations Environment Program, UNOCHA, and the Green Cross in 2013. He is also the co-author of the World Bank-funded publication, Natural Security: Protected Areas and Hazard Mitigation which was launched at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties.  

At DAI, Jonathan leads business development, technical assistance, and project management with a focus on climate change, environment, natural resource management, and water resources.
