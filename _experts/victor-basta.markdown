Victor is the founder and CEO of DAI Magister, DAI's capital advisory arm. 

Victor has advised on over 130 transactions across 30 years, and has helped found and build three successful corporate finance firms in the process. His orientation has always been towards sell-side financings and M&A, where experience and creativity can yield additional value to investors and founders of later stage growth companies. 

At DAI Magister, Victor personally leads the firmâ€™s African advisory effort, and has handled the sale of Baxi to MFS Africa, and fundraisings for Twiga Foods, M-KOPA, and CloudFactory, amongst others. 

Prior to founding DAI Magister, Victor was founder and managing partner of Arma Partners LLP, global co-head of Broadview prior to its sale to Jefferies, and an Adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship at INSEAD.
