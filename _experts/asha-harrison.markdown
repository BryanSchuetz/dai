Asha Harrison is a project manager with experience bringing innovative project design and management approaches to conflict, transitional, and stabilization contexts.

Asha has designed and implemented development projects worldwide since 2004, specializing in stabilization activity design and project implementation in transitional environments. Since beginning her professional career, she has worked on projects in Costa Rica, East Timor, Liberia, Philippines, Thailand, and the United Kingdom; designed activities for programs in Nigeria and Trinidad; and led activity implementation in Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, and Sri Lanka. Asha comes to us most recently from the U.S. Agency for International Development mission in Mali, where she worked as Conflict and Governance Advisor with the Peace, Democracy, and Governance Office.  Asha’s relationship with DAI began with her second tour to eastern Sri Lanka in 2010. She finally joined the DAI family as a permanent member of the Center for Secure and Stable States (CS3) in 2018, bringing her expertise to the countering violent extremism portfolio.   

Hailing originally from the United Kingdom, Asha speaks French and Russian and lives with her husband and well-traveled Labrador.
