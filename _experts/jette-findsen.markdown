Jette Findsen has experience working internationally and domestically on issues of climate change, natural resources management, clean energy, and climate finance. At DAI, she oversees a portfolio of projects in the Environment practice and leads DAI’s strategy for climate change with the U.S. Government. She also provides cross-sector assistance to projects focused on green finance, sustainable urban planning, carbon markets, carbon labeling, climate governance, green procurement, economic analysis of climate change mitigation and adaptation options, and strengthening of monitoring, reporting, and verification systems for greenhouse gas management.

She previously worked as the Senior Program Officer, Climate Investment Standards at the American Carbon Registry, where she led an initiative to standardize the quantification of environmental impacts of green bonds and other green debt instruments. She also worked for Abt Associates as a Senior Associate and Climate Change Coordinator, where she launched an international and domestic climate change practice and led projects to support economic analysis and low-carbon, climate-resilient planning by cities and national governments. 

Previously, she led LEIDOS’ climate change practice, assisting federal agencies, state and local governments, financial institutions, utilities, and international development institutions with climate and sustainability planning in the transportation, energy, waste, water, forestry, and agriculture sectors. Jette also managed LEIDOS’ contract to help the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) develop a reporting system for its mandatory Greenhous Gas Reporting Program, which tracks facility-level emissions from the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., and she developed greenhouse gas inventory and carbon offsets protocols for the Climate Action Reserve, the Climate Registry, and the EPA Climate Leaders program.

Jette serves on the Anne Arundel County Maryland Citizen Environmental Commission.
