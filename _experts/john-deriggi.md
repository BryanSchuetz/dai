John DeRiggi is a spatial products developer with 10 years of experience in software and data engineering. John learned Java in college and started his career developing Java-based web applications, which were used to help analysts make sense of massive data sets. He became interested in spatial technology after building three-dimensional visualizations in Google Earth in 2006. After working in Washington, D.C., for a few years he to moved to Partners in Health, where he spent a year in Rwanda teaching programing and developing components for an open source medical record system. John's ties to Rwanda remain strong as he has returned to the country four times since leaving at the end of 2009, once to go camping on the rim of a Congolese volcano. At the World Bank, he built a system for sharing climate data, which supported the 2012 Apps for Climate contest and was added to the Bank's portfolio of open data products.
