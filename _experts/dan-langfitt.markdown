Dan Langfitt is an international development professional with more than 12 years of experience at both the community and country levels, including almost nine years at DAI. He provides support to a variety of projects around the world, leads new-business efforts to win proposals, and develops training and communications products related to DAIâ€™s economic growth, resilience, and social inclusion work. Dan brings a systems approach to changing rural livelihoods and natural resource management in developing countries, notably Haiti, Mozambique, and the eastern Congo. He specializes in facilitating long-term change in complex systems, building teams driven by adaptive learning, and designing and testing innovations, especially in fragile and emerging markets. He also worked in Eastern Europe and West Africa, in areas ranging from preparing for pandemic threats to catalyzing innovation, supporting DAI teams to deliver on the contractual, financial, and technical requirements of its donor-funded projects. 

In his most recent job overseas, Dan served on the leadership team of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience Activity in the eastern DRC and supported a team of Congolese professionals learning to do development differently to help the conflict-stricken emerge from the cycle of recurring crises and humanitarian aid more competitive and inclusive, and with a socio-economic system that is more resilient in the face of future shocks and stresses. 

Prior to working at DAI, he managed a community agro-forestry project in Haiti's Artibonite Valley.
