Patrick Cleary heads the investment management division of DAI Capital. He brings more than 18 years of principal investment experience across the emerging markets, holding senior positions in developing, deploying, and managing dedicated funds.

Patrick was Managing Director, Private Investments, with Albright Capital Management (ACM), a multi-strategy investment firm dedicated to the emerging markets. As a senior deal partner and member of ACM’s investment committee, he played an important role in developing the firm’s private investment business and strong track record. The private investment portfolio included more than $500 million of mezzanine/structured minority, secondary debt, and private equity investments across the emerging markets. 

Prior to joining ACM in 2008, he was a senior investment professional at Franklin Templeton’s emerging markets private equity arm Darby Private Equity. At Darby, he led some of the best-performing investments of Darby’s pioneering $195 million Latin America Mezzanine Fund, which served as the foundation for Darby’s expanded offering of mezzanine funds to other emerging markets. In 2006, Patrick relocated to Vienna, Austria, as a founding member of the team that led Darby’s expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. While there, he worked on the fundraising and initial investment phase of a €300 million regional fund. 

Patrick has been a board member of multiple portfolio companies operating in the emerging markets, including Helios Towers Africa, Termobarraquilla, Avantel, and APR Energy, among others. Patrick started his career as an investment banker with Chase Securities in New York covering Latin America.
