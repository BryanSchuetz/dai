Cathy Shaw is the Director of Evidence, Learning & TA Facilities for DAI's UK and Europe units. Formerly a researcher in economic development in transition countries, Cathy has worked on long-term programs in Nigeria and Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, including eight years working with counter-proliferation initiatives to generate civilian jobs for former nuclear weapons sector workers in the former Soviet Union. Having joined DAI in 2001, Cathy has since acted as project director for a range of European Union and Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)-funded projects in eastern Europe and the Caucasus, and east and southern Africa, focusing on climate change and resilience issues. She also previously managed the [Evidence on Demand](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-evidence-demand-core-services) (EoD) program, which provided quality-assured research and evidence materials and rapid response call-down services for climate and environment, infrastructure, and livelihoods programs worldwide.
