Frank O’Brien has more than 25 years of experience working to develop market systems and promote public-private partnerships in East and Southern Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. He has spent much of his professional career managing and providing technical assistance to multi-year agricultural projects in complex operating environments with a strong private sector and trade expansion focus. He has also designed and implemented seven U.S. Agency for International Development-funded projects, often in the role of Chief of Party. Most recently on the USAID Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub and previously the USAID Tajikistan Agribusiness Competitiveness Activity of Tajikistan, he leveraged his technical knowledge to ensure these projects stimulated economic growth, increased employment, and improved livelihoods across Southern Africa and Central Asia, respectively. Previously, he served as Chief of Party on programs in [Lebanon](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/lebanon-industry-value-chain-development-livcd) and Rwanda.
