Michelle Morgan is accountable for the overall performance of the U.S. Government Programs division. A five-time Chief of Party who brings to the job decades of project implementation, corporate oversight, and team leadership experience, she is responsible for effective project management and outstanding development outcomes.

Prior to her current role, she was Senior Portfolio Director for Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. She has dedicated a career of nearly 30 years to private sector development—building local knowledge, skills, and processes for market-driven, sustainable economic growth. Most of her career has been in conflict zones or countries in transition, most recently Afghanistan. Her leadership skills are as strong as her technical accomplishments, making her one of the rare Chiefs of Party who can effectively manage large programs and undertake necessary, sometimes significant, adjustments without losing momentum or stakeholders’ confidence.

Michelle has held management roles on several major donor-funded economic growth initiatives in Afghanistan, Croatia, Egypt, and Mongolia. She started her career in international development at Nathan Associates, where she worked for 13 years on assignments in trade, standards and certification, transportation, and industry competitiveness. More recently her work has focused on product development, export marketing, and employment creation across a wide range of value chains, along with women’s economic empowerment and the application of technology in development delivery.
