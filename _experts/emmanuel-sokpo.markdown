Dr. Emmanuel Sokpo is a specialist clinician with extensive training in public health. He has more than 30 years of experience in health systems strengthening at various levels, with a particular focus on health policy, planning, leadership, governance, and management system strengthening in fragile and resource-scarce areas of Africa. He advises the Women for Health program, which aims to train 6,000 female health workers in rural northern Nigeria; the Neglected Tropical Diseases control program in Nigeria; and the multi-donor Health Pooled Fund Project in South Sudan, supporting policy, strategy, planning and implementation at national, state, and county levels.

He has worked both in the public and nonprofit health sectors. He was the medical superintendent at Mkar Missionary Hospital, one of the largest missionary hospitals in Nigeria. As the CEO of the Benue State Government Hospitals Management Board, he participated in health policy formulation at state and national levels. He co-managed the Benue Health Fund Project supporting integrated health system strengthening whose success and lessons led to other larger programs supporting integrated health system strengthening reforms.
