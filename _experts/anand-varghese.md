He works with clients to develop digital strategies, design and implement digital-focused activities, train staff on the use of digital platforms for development, and identify local partners. He serves as a technical advisor to the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) project, and has served as a technical advisor to the Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) in Accra, Ghana, where he helped young technology entrepreneurs develop digital solutions for the local agricultural sector. He also teaches a course, "Digital Development: Innovative Use of Technology in Emerging Markets," at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. Prior to joining DAI, he served as Senior Manager at the PeaceTech Lab at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Anand played an integral role in creating and launching the Lab, the Institute’s first nonprofit spin-off in its 30-year history.
