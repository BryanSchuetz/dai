Barry Flaming is an international development professional with over 25 years of diverse experience in managing natural resource governance, climate mitigation finance, biodiversity conservation, private sector engagement, and nature-based solutions interventions. 
His work with local communities has inspired his learning journey, from collaborating with indigenous communities on community-based natural resource management, land use planning, and livelihood programs at the village level to leading multi-country USAID initiatives that mobilize private sector investment, promote responsible timber trade, address wildlife trafficking, and strengthen environmental governance.

Before joining DAI in 2023, Barry led USAID Green Invest Asia’s private sector development and technical service delivery in partnership with multinational corporates and investors across various commodities, including coffee, cacao, coconut, rice, rubber, timber, biomass, and carbon. Building on these efforts, Barry advances integrated approaches and fosters innovative multistakeholder collaborations to tackle today’s complex environmental and development challenges.

As a member of DAI’s Climate, Land, and Natural Resources practice in our global Environment team, Barry provides a wide range of business development services, technical assistance, and advisory support to ongoing USAID projects. He is proficient in Thai and has work experience in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries.
