Kevin Carlucci is a development professional with more than 20 years of experience across a diverse set of disciplines, including finance, natural resource management, economic policy reform, and emerging market economic development. He led the establishment of DAI’s first Climate Change practice, learning alongside the U.S. Agency for International Development how climate programming would work in the 2010s. 

After 10 years of supporting biodiversity, water, and climate programs at DAI, in 2018 he moved to Maputo to serve in a technical role—and eventually, Chief of Party—for the [Mozambique SPEED+ program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-support-program-economic-and-enterprise-development-speed), which focused on policy reform in agriculture, land tenure, trade, power, water, and biodiversity conservation. In his current role as Senior Director for the Climate, Land, & Natural Resources Practice, Kevin manages a portfolio of programs across Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

With a keen interest in integrated programs, Kevin now brings his cross-sectoral expertise to bear on resilience programming that incorporates a mix of social, environmental, and economic safeguards that are critical to weathering all shocks, from pandemics to extreme weather events. He has a personal interest in integrated water resource management, climate finance, and eco-agricultural systems.

Proficient in Portuguese and Spanish, Kevin has worked across Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
