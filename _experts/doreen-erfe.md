Prior to this, she served as Senior Policy and Institutional Development Specialist of the [USAID Philippine Water Revolving Fund Support Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-water-revolving-fund-support-program-pwrf) and as Deputy Chief of Party and Senior Policy Development Specialist of its follow-on program. In her current position, she manages policy and governance-related initiatives focusing on financing and regulatory reforms in the water supply and sanitation sector and capacity-building activities to improve access of local government units and water service providers to financing for water supply and sanitation investments.

Doreen has helped draft policies and guidelines on the rationalization of public resource allocation and economic regulation of water supply and sanitation sector. She has packaged knowledge products on water utility governance and performance improvement, and innovative financing schemes such as the output-based aid with blended finance and payments for ecosystem services which have served as a reference in capacity-building activities for water utilities and the local government units.
