Doreen Erfe joined the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Philippine Water Revolving Fund Support Program in 2008 as Senior Policy and Institutional Development Specialist. As the current Deputy Chief of Party and Senior Policy Development Specialist of the follow-on program, she manages policy-related initiatives focusing on financing and regulatory reforms in the water supply and sanitation sector and capacity-building activities to improve regulation and water service provision. In her work, she maintains close rapport with government entities from executive and legislative branches involved in policy development and regulation and water service providers (e.g., water districts, local government units, co-ops and private utilities). Doreen has helped draft policies on the rationalization of public resource allocation and economic regulation of water supply and sanitation and developed guidelines for the implementation of the government's water supply program for waterless municipalities. She has packaged knowledge products on water utility governance and performance improvement, which have served as reference in capacity-building activities for water utilities. Her expertise also includes microfinance, program monitoring, and gender development. Before working with DAI, she was involved in the implementation of various foreign-assisted projects funded by the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency in the fields of credit and microfinance, environment, enterprise, and rural development.
