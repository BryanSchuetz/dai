Georgia Iordanescu provides strategic vision and leadership for DAI’s global portfolio of clean energy and climate projects, energy sector security, governance, and private sector engagement. Georgia drives a holistic approach to transition global systems towards sustainability, resiliency, and equity through her energy expertise and cross-sectoral in-depth knowledge of the climate-energy nexus, energy security, finance, and geopolitics.

A former Director for Energy at Chemonics, she was a core member of the first acquisition in the company’s history. In less than three years, she helped establish the foundation of the Sustainable Energy Transition technical practice and secure two landmark USAID programs for the energy sectors in Sri Lanka and Serbia.
 
Georgia spent more than a decade of her career designing and implementing specialized approaches to increase the availability, access, and use of affordable, reliable, and sustainable clean energy technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia. 

As a Hitachi Research Institute Fellow in Japan, she advised on environmental sustainability policies and market entry strategies for renewable energy technologies.
