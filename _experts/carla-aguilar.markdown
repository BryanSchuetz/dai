As a former scholarship recipient of a USAID/Guatemala leadership scholarship program, I began my professional career working with force displaced
 populations in Guatemala during the civil war. Throughout twenty-five years of my professional career I have worked with governmental and non-governmental institutions, including being an alternate representative of Guatemala to the Organization of American
 States (OAS) in Washington DC. I have been working with USAID related activities for almost fifteen years, first as FSN in Guatemala and then as TCN in South Sudan. I move to the private sector as DCOP of an Access to Justice Activity in Colombia and then
 to Honduras where I'm a COP for the Honduras Local Governance Activity. All my life I have worked with democracy and development related activities.


About the potential quote:

"Women in development are a key factor to success.  We need to think that almost all the Program Manager and Associates at DAI are women, they are the engine that moves all projects around the globe. But when it comes to highest positions the  balance change. We need to think what are the barriers women have to grow up professional and work together to overpass those barriers".
