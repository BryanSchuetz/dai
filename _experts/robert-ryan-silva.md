Robert Ryan-Silva is an international development professional with almost 30 years of experience using systems approaches to achieve development results. Rob joined DAI in 2002. 

Robâ€™s specialty is engaging in deep contextual analysis to craft development innovations that work. By closely examining and modeling complete systems (spoken and unspoken needs of stakeholders, systems and the often implicit subsystems and ecosystems they rely on, the needs of donors, and more), Rob fashions sometimes unexpected interventions that are compatible with important parameters that others often miss. This deep systems approach links a diverse range of accomplishments, whether as Chief of Party of the [RESPOND](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-respond) project, building defenses against emerging infectious diseases, or building electronic hardware and capacities to build hardware in support of DAI projects around the world.  

He has experience working with projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Prior to joining DAI, Rob managed operations for the Egypt field office of the Centre for Development and Population Activities and worked for other international development implementers.
