After four years in southern Africa, Benjamin Rinehart returned to his native Washington, D.C., to join DAI's Technical Services team and support its practice in food security, agriculture, and livelihoods. As a seasoned proposal writer, technical specialist, and Chief of Party, he brings significant depth of experience in providing strategic direction to program design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation in multiple areas: livelihoods, agriculture, food security, gender, markets and trade, vulnerability assessment methodology, climate adaptation, and resilience.

Previously, he served as Chief of Party to the U.S. Agency International Development (USAID)-funded Community Based Livelihoods Development for Women and Children in Swaziland project, improving the well-being of women and children through integrated community and national level programs in value chain, enterprise, and savings group development, child protection, and the promotion of legal rights, services, and entitlements.

Prior to joining AED, Ben led solutions and proposal development food security programs at Booz Allen Hamilton. He began his career in international development at Chemonics International, serving first as an analyst at USAID's trade hub in Botswana, and for several years as a food security analyst for the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). There he developed communications tools and provided analyses to support USAID and host-country disaster preparedness and humanitarian response efforts.
