Colleen Green graduated from the University of Oregon in 1989 with a dual major in international studies and German. Times were different—the Cold War was still going on, nuclear threats loomed, and job prospects were slim. In August 1989, Colleen began a one-year internship in the German parliament with Social Democrat Renate Schmidt from Nuremberg. Weeks later, the world changed: the Berlin Wall, communism, and centrally planned economies fell, and she convinced her new boss of the unique opportunity to participate in the first free election in East Germany. Colleen continued her post-graduate work in Russia and Ukraine, assisting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in building organizations for the Russian stock exchange, reforming former state-owned enterprises, and helping small businesses register, expand, and gain access to finance.
