Kathryn Erskine credits her father, who is a cultural anthropologist, for sparking her interest in international affairs. After spending many of her childhood years living and traveling abroad, she knew she wanted to pursue a career in international development.

She currently serves on our U.S. Government (USG) Business Unit's Executive Team and oversees the People function for 5,000 global staff. Her responsibilities include overseeing human resource operations (compensation, benefits, HR analytics, and HR systems); talent acquisition; learning and development; project human resources; and diversity, equity, engagement, and inclusion efforts for the USG Business and other U.S.-based business units.
