As DAI’s President, Tine Knott works closely with the CEO to ensure strategic alignment and optimal business performance across the company. She directly oversees DAI’s development sector businesses, private sector consulting team, and corporate strategy and operations worldwide, including the strategy and marketing functions, information technology, global facilities, human capital, and security.

Before assuming her current role, Tine served as Executive Vice President for Strategy and Global Operations and Senior VP of DAI’s U.S. Government Business—our largest business unit.

In 2017, Tine launched and led DAI’s Center for Secure and Stable States with a mission to raise the bar for development and security programming in fragile environments. For the three years prior, she was Managing Director for Governance, Transition, and Stability, responsible for the company’s governance, stabilization, political transition, countering violent extremism, peacebuilding, citizen security, and public financial management portfolio.

Before joining DAI in 2011, Tine spent 15 years with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Washington D.C., Jordan, Mozambique, Ghana, and Peru. In her final USAID assignment, as Senior Development Advisor in Jordan, she developed cross-sectoral and politically sensitive programming in human rights, good governance, and poverty, and was responsible for managing relationships with host government counterparts, other U.S. Government agencies, civil society, and the media.

Tine is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish with skills in French and Norwegian. She completed the Wharton School’s Advanced Management Program in 2022.
