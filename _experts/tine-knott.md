Tine Knott leads our corporate strategy and operations worldwide, including the strategy and marketing functions, information technology, global facilities, human capital, and security. 

Before assuming her current role, Tine served as Senior Vice President of DAI’s U.S. Government Business—our largest business unit—developing, marketing, and delivering development solutions for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the State Department, and other U.S. Government clients.

In 2017, Tine launched DAI’s Center for Secure and Stable States with a mission to raise the bar for development and security programming in fragile environments. For the three years prior, she was Managing Director for Governance, Transition, and Stability, responsible for the company’s portfolio of good governance, stabilization, political transition, countering violent extremism, peacebuilding, citizen security, and public financial management work.

Before joining DAI in 2011, Tine spent 15 years with USAID in Ghana, Jordan, Mozambique, and Peru, as well as in Washington, D.C. In her final USAID assignment, as the Senior Development Advisor in Jordan, she developed cross-sectoral and politically sensitive programming in human rights, good governance, and poverty, and was responsible for managing relationships with host government counterparts, other U.S. Government agencies, civil society, and the media.

Tine is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish with skills in French and Norwegian. She holds an M.S in international development from the University of Pennsylvania and completed the Wharton School’s Advanced Management Program in 2022.
