Gavin Chan started his career in project and structured finance at BNP Paribas in Sydney, Australia, before moving to New York to advise on Utilities and Infrastructure Funds on mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring transactions. For more than 10 years in Asia, he held senior investment banking roles at Rothschild and HSBC specializing in merger and acquisition transactions, but also helping companies tap public capital markets. Most recently, at a consulting firm, he helped small- to medium-sized enterprise entrepreneurs that were seeking private capital for expansion.  

Gavin brings more than 25 years of investment and financing experience across public and private funding markets in debt and equities.
