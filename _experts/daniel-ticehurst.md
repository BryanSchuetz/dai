Daniel started his career playing cricket for Hampshire County Cricket Club, but after completing his degree in geography and development economics and volunteering in India on an irrigation project, he went on to do a master's degree and pursue a career in the field of international development. Over the next 10 years, Daniel worked on long-term monitoring and evaluation (M&E) positions in Bangladesh, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, on initiatives supported by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the World Bank, The Community Development Resource Network, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and Danida.

From 1997 to 2003, he was based in the United Kingdom, working first for the Natural Resources Institute mostly on M&E-related assignments and then for the U.K. Department for Trade and Industry as head of performance management. The next seven years were spent on long-term assignments in Tanzania, where he was a chief technical advisor for a UN agriculture programme; in Lesotho, leading a DFID job creation and food security programme; and in Australia, where he was a Principal Advisor for Aid Effectiveness for the Australian Government's aid programme.

Since joining HTSPE, now DAI, in 2010, Daniel has focused much of his attention on developing systems that put to use financial and non-financial measures of performance in ways that help managers learn from clients through being accountable to them. He is currently leading the development of such systems for a multidonor-funded business sector programme led by Danida, a health programme in Timor-Leste, and a trade integration programme in Vietnam, the latter two funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
