Walter Weaver has 18 years of experience working on diverse development projects worldwide. At 13, he moved to Alexandria, Egypt, where his father was working on a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) wastewater project.

Inspired by the work his father did, he resolved to pursue a similar career in international development, driven by the conviction that the Earth is a closed loop system, and shaping a more livable world requires that we all contribute to keeping it healthy.

> "Water is the ultimate cross-cutting theme; it impacts everyone and everything we do." â€” Walter Weaver

He has led policy development and innovative financing approaches, including public sector instruments and commercial bank loan guarantees in Central America and Peru.
