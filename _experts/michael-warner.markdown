Michael Warner is one of the world’s leading authorities on local content in the context of the oil and gas, mining, and infrastructure sectors. He is Managing Director of Local Content Solutions Ltd. (LCS), an advisory and training company providing services to operators, regulators, and international suppliers on local content policy, regulation, strategy, local market gap analysis, tender procedures, and performance reporting metrics. [LCS was acquired by DAI in 2017](/news/dai-joins-forces-with-local-content-solutions-ltd).

As the founder and lead trainer of the formally accredited and highly successful LCS Local Content Master Class, Michael has trained more than 400 professionals in local content, and he is the architect of LCS Reports, the widely used online local content reporting tool.

Michael has 30 years of experience aligning businesses and company performance with the economic, social, and environmental policies and priorities of host countries. He has worked in more than 30 countries in Africa, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
