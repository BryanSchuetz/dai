Matthew Dixon joined DAI’s Sustainable Business Group in 2019, where he works to strengthen the project and financial management of the team’s growing portfolio of work. Matthew’s current projects focus on local enterprise development programs within the oil and gas industry. He supports the [Centre for Local Business Development in Guyana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guyana-centre-for-local-business-development) that DAI manages on behalf of ExxonMobil, and DAI’s advisory services to [Shell LiveWIRE](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-shell-livewire-global-consultancy).

Prior to DAI, Matthew co-managed two EU-funded food security projects at Landell Mills Ltd., a U.K.-based international development consultancy. He also conducted research at the interface of biodiversity science and policy at the UN Environment-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, ultimately leading a team to develop a new ecosystem indicator for the Ramsar Convention.
