Matthew Dixon joined DAI’s Sustainable Business Group in 2019, where he works to strengthen the project and financial management of the team’s growing portfolio of work. Matthew’s current projects focus on local enterprise development programs within the oil and gas industry. He supports the [Centre for Local Business Development in Guyana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guyana-centre-for-local-business-development) that DAI manages on behalf of ExxonMobil, and DAI’s advisory services to [Shell LiveWIRE](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-shell-livewire-global-consultancy).

Prior to DAI, Matthew co-managed two European Union-funded food security projects at Landell Mills Ltd., a U.K. international development consultancy. He also conducted research at the interface of biodiversity science and policy at the UN Environment-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, ultimately leading a team to develop a new ecosystem indicator for the Ramsar Convention. Matthew brings experience working with government, intergovernmental, and private sector clients, as well as performing research, analysis, technical writing, and project management.
