Clare Callahan provides project management, financial management, business development, and technical support to DAI's Sustainable Business Group. Clare analyzes policies related to oil, gas, mining, and energy access to advise clients on their investment strategies. Her work includes identifying markets for investment in off-grid generation in the Niger Delta, an assignment that entailed data and policy analysis related to community-level energy consumption and national power legislation.
