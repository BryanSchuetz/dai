Alex is a Harvard-trained public administration professional with a unique combination of skills in tax policy, tax and customs administration, tax and financial accounting, trade, economics, and public finance. Over the past 18 years, Alex has helped countries strike a balance between creating an enabling business environment and generating revenues for public sector services and infrastructure. He has worked to reform public finance, tax, and customs architecture in some 15 countries, among them: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Georgia, Moldova, Kosovo, Philippines, Russia, South Sudan, and Tajikistan. His clients have included the U.S. Agency for International Development, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Union, and United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
