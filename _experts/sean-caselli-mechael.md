Outside of the classroom, Sean's first exposure to international development challenges came in the form of a group of teenage boys from the Langa Township in South Africa. Rather than teaching algebra or history, Sean's work at the LEAP Science & Maths School centered on buy-in, ownership, and incentives. "All five were gifted students with a world of potential," he said. "Their growth as young men and community leaders depended directly on their investment and commitment to school and studies." This experience inspired Sean's own commitment to international development, with a particular interest in localized and high-potential development solutions.

> "We have reached a time in both technological innovative and international development where ICT4D is not just about finding and implementing a flashy, new platform. Real impact happens when you can harmonize the human elements of our work—ownership, capacity, and culture for starters—with a user-driven approach and context-appropriate solution." —Sean Caselli-Mechael

From seedy industrial towns in Mozambique to beautiful but poorly resourced islands in the Caribbean, Sean has applied these principles to design, support, and implement innovative information and communications technology (ICT) solutions for development programs. "The popularity of mobiles and growth of Internet access across the globe represents an unprecedented multiplier for development impact in all sectors, from economic growth and disaster management to public health and governance." In his current role at DAI, Sean leverages his experience generating new ICT business across the international donor community and hands-on understanding of implementation challenges, best practices, and constraints to support the ICT Geo Services team.
