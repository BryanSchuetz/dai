> "We have reached a time in both technological innovative and international development where ICT4D is not just about finding and implementing a flashy, new platform. Real impact happens when you can harmonize the human elements of our work—ownership, capacity, and culture for starters—with a user-driven approach and context-appropriate solution." —Sean Caselli-Mechael
