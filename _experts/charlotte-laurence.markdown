Charlotte Laurence leads the Global Health portfolio for DAI UK, focusing on program delivery, technical strategy, and proposal development. She provides technical support on global health policy and financing, and led DAIâ€™s U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)-funded [Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa (TDDA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-tackling-deadly-diseases-in-africa-program) program. TDDA worked in six sub-Saharan countries to strengthen health systems and institutions to deliver better global health security and improve disease preparedness and response. 

Charlotte has over 20 years of experience in designing, managing, and reviewing programs and service delivery systems in Africa and Asia. Her specialism is using political analysis to understand the constraints to effective health service delivery and designing more effective delivery systems that better reflect the local context. 

She has worked extensively with donors, including the FCDO; European Union; Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; United Nations Children's Fund; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; United Nations Development Programme; and USAID, as well as providing consultancy services for private sector clients. 

Her experience includes working with the high-level UNAIDS team that developed and piloted national technical support planning to prioritize, harmonize, and align technical support to low-income countries. Charlotte has worked and consulted in Bangladesh, China, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
