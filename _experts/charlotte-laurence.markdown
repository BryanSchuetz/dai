Charlotte Laurence is a Senior Health Advisor for DAI Global Health, focusing on programme delivery, technical strategy, and proposal development. She provides expert support to the [Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa (TDDA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-tackling-deadly-diseases-in-africa-program) programme. TDDA works in six sub-Saharan countries to strengthen health systems and institutions to deliver better health security and improve disease preparedness and response. 

Charlotte has nearly 20 years’ experience in designing, managing, and reviewing programmes and service delivery systems in Africa and Asia. Her specialism is in using political analysis to understand the constraints to effective health service delivery and design more effective delivery systems that better reflect the local context. 

She has worked extensively with donors including the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; European Union; Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (UNAIDS); United Nations Children's Fund; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; United Nations Development Programme; and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as providing consultancy services to private sector clients. 

Her experience includes working with the high-level UNAIDS team that developed and piloted national technical support planning to prioritise, harmonise, and align technical support to low-income countries. She has been nominated by China’s State Council AIDS Working Committee for an award for "Outstanding contribution to China’s response to HIV/AIDS by an international expert." Charlotte has worked and consulted in Bangladesh, China, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
