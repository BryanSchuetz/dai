After completing her master’s degree in business administration in the United States, Olga returned to her home country, Turkmenistan, to apply her new skills as a finance and administrative manager in the country’s burgeoning oil and gas and construction sectors. Her first jobs were with ConocoPhillips and CIFAL, where she specialized in identifying and analyzing Turkmenistan’s local content requirements on infrastructure projects. After learning to successfully navigate the complex landscape of local content regulation, she shifted her efforts to local supply product management, helping to design a new business unit and service offerings around local supply chains.
