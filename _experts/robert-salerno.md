Robert Salerno serves as the Director for DAI’s Health Security practice. In this role, he leads the development, design, and execution of new programs that address a wide range of issues at the animal-human-environmental intersection. A global health expert, he most recently served as the Technical Integration Manager on the [Preparedness and Response (P&R)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr) project, where he was responsible for establishing global best practices, ensuring technical excellence, and delivering solutions to national staff tasked with strengthening multisectoral coordination to prevent, prepare and respond to infectious disease events. 

In this capacity, Robert was the lead architect of a global benchmarking framework, the [One Health Assessment for Planning and Performance (OH-APP)](https://www.onehealthapp.org/about), that has been used as a self-assessment tool in 15 countries. Prior to his position on P&R, he served as global practice specialist, where he provided support and subject matter expertise to the environment and health teams. He also served as a technical advisor for the [Jordan Competitiveness Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/jordan-competitiveness-program-jcp) while leading the design and implementation of several program evaluations. Robert served as technical manager for the [Urban Gardens Program for HIV-Affected Women and Children (UGP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-urban-gardens-program-hiv-affected-women-and-children-ugp) in Ethiopia, and from 2009 to 2010, and as the technical officer on the [RESPOND](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-respond) program, designing program implementation strategies.

Since 2008, Robert has provided expert technical assistance to more than a dozen DAI health, economic growth, and environment projects—focusing on strategy development; measurement, evaluation, and analysis issues; policy formulation and development and data use for decision making. He currently serves as an expert member on two external technical advisory groups for the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. A Fellow of the Salzburg Global Seminar, Robert is passionate about applying One Health multisectoral approaches to disease prevention, detection, preparedness, and response and regularly lectures and publishes on this topic. He has performed assignments in more than 20 countries across Southeast Asia, East and Central Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, but found his love for international development serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Fiji Islands.
