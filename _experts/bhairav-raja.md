He has experience of working with hard-to-reach target segments (both households and small firms) in fragile financial sectors in Africa. He has strong financial inclusion diagnostic experience and toolkit development, taking a holistic approach to examining demand, supply and regulation across savings, credit, insurance, and payment systems.
