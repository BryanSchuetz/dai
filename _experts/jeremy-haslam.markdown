Jeremy “Jez” Haslam is an international development and crisis response specialist with more than 17 years of experience delivering programs in countries facing complex emergencies, conflict, or political transition. As Senior Principal Global Practice Leader, he is responsible for the management and integration of technical and operational aspects of our portfolio of projects in Burma, Kenya, Pakistan, and the Philippines. 

Previously Director, Political Transitions Practice Area with Creative Associates International, he managed USAID/OTI initiatives promoting crime and violence reduction in Honduras, the Community Cohesion Initiative in Afghanistan, the CVE initiatives in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Pakistan, and the USAID West Africa-funded Partnerships for Peace regional CVE program. Jez served two consecutive posts as Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Libya (2011-2012) and Uganda (2007-2011). During the 2011 Libya uprising, Mr. Haslam planned and coordinated the IOM in-country crisis response operations to safely evacuate thousands of migrant workers stranded in the Libyan conflict zones by land, sea and air. In intervening periods (2012-2014), Mr. Haslam has served as an SME in support of US Marine Corps and US Army JMRC training exercises for future humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions and as a USAID/OTI Acting Chief of Party in Afghanistan.
Mr. Haslam has extensive knowledge and experience of post-crisis community stabilization initiatives, including socio-economic reintegration of disenfranchised groups and community-based approaches to resiliency. During his 12yrs of service with IOM, Mr. Haslam developed broad experience in the management of programs and projects in the field of migration management, encompassing migration policy development and legislative reviews; immigration and border management; civil-military contingency planning for mass migration; refugee resettlement operations; labor migration; migration health; identity management systems; counter-trafficking; population data collection & analyses; electoral observation and out-of-country voting operations.
Formerly a British Army Officer, Mr. Haslam saw operational service in Kosovo (1999-2000) as part of the NATO Peace Keeping Force (KFOR), where he monitored and enforced compliance with the Military Technical Agreement, which provided the framework for the Kosovo Liberation Army’s disarmament demobilization and reintegration through transition to a civil protection and emergency response force, known as the Kosovo Protection Corps.
