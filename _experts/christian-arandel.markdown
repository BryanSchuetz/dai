In Chicago, as an exchange student from France, Christian Arandel discovered his love for cities. There, he supported local community development efforts and interned with the Chicago Urban League to support housing foreclosure policy reform.  This marked the beginning of his interest for local governance. After studying Urban Planning and International development at the University of Michigan, Christian moved to Cairo where, for the next eight years, he managed a regional UN program to strengthen urban management and governance in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen.  

Upon his return to the US, he joined RTI International as a local governance specialist working on programs and new business in Morocco and Iraq and Africa.  In 2005 he took on the role of Chief of Party (COP) for the Morocco Local Governance Program (LGP-2005 to 2008).  He was also technical advisor and/or manager for several governance programs, including the Iraq Local Governance Project (LGP) and the Guinea Faisons Ensemble project, Senegal’s Governance for Local Development (GOLD) and the Morocco Local Governance Program 2 (LGP2).  In 2018, Christian joined Counterpart International where he played a leading role in building the organization’s portfolio of local governance, peace building and security sector governance portfolio of projects in the Sahel.  He is also the lead author of Counterpart’s Inclusive Social Accountability framework (ISA).
Christian joined DAI in June 2023 as a Senior Lead Specialist for Local Governance to support project implementation and new business development in Africa, the MENA region, and wherever else he may be needed.
