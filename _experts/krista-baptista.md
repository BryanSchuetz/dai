From her early research in cultural anthropology to subsequent work in management consulting, Krista has always been engaged around ways to do things better and empower entrepreneurs to use new skills and tools. Combining this background with an interest in international development led her to DAI and, specifically, to the ways that information and communication technology (ICT) and digital can be integrated into development work to accelerate development impacts and make people’s lives better. As the leader of DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, Krista is responsible for leading the team, advancing the Center’s strategy, and delivering on project commitments to high-quality digital work. Krista works with the USAID Digital Frontiers Project and frequently speaks on the future of technology and digital jobs, the digital principles, women and digital, and other topics. She also lectures on Digital Innovations for Emerging Markets at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
