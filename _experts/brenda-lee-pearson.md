In the tragic wake of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the Balkans and Rwanda in the 1990s, Brenda Lee Pearson and a dozen colleagues launched the International Crisis Group (ICG) to better monitor the drivers of insecurity and conflict. As the Chief of Party for the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Macedonia, she saw the telltale signs of another "ethnic war" simmering in Kosovo and Macedonia. Brenda co-created ICG's effective digital crisis early warning, which continues to provide highly detailed analysis and advice to prevent, manage and resolve conflict and rebuild after it.

Over the past 25 years, Brenda has been at the forefront of new strategic and tactical thinking about the international community's complex and multilayered responses to humanitarian crises and conflicts. She is an experienced Chief of Party for projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and was a senior director at the UN World Food Programme.

> "I am a passionate advocate for the equitable treatment of women, girls, and minorities. We know that gender bias and ethnic, religious, and sexual discrimination are ultimately a threat to the peace and the security of an entire community or country." â€” Brenda Lee Pearson

At DAI, Brenda contributes a sharper and deeper focus to DAI's work in livelihoods and resilience, which is essential for building more accountable, stable, and inclusive societies that protect women, youth, refugees, and religious and ethnic minorities. From her field work in 32 countries in Africa, Asia, Central America, Eurasia, Europe, and the Middle East, she has witnessed the direct consequences of how food insecurity and conflicts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

Her technical areas of expertise are conflict, food security and nutrition, resilience, gender, social inclusion, and institutional capacity development. Brenda has authored 100 articles and conference presentations and edited two books on post-conflict development programming for inclusion of vulnerable populations and building community resilience. She was awarded the Jennings Randolph Senior Fellowship at the U.S. Institute for Peace in 2001 and served on the White House Task Force for Kosovo.
