Del McCluskey was introduced to international development in 1963 when his father joined the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Growing up in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and seeing his father work to improve agriculture production and food security, instilled in Del a passion to make a difference in the world.

Twenty years later, Del joined USAID and led several groundbreaking programs that included supporting the diversification of the Dominican Republic's and Honduras' agriculture exports; establishing the Honduran Agriculture Research Foundation, one of the first public-private partnerships in agriculture research that still thrives today; designing and testing approaches for community-based management of informal land rights for indigenous Filipinos; and developing one of USAID's first climate change programs.

> "I learned early that real change occurs when the beneficiaries own the program and results and say at the end that 'we did this ourselves.' — Del McCluskey

Since joining DAI in 2004, Del has helped conceptualize and establish the first revolving fund outside of the United States for financing water and sanitation infrastructure, which secured clean water for hundreds of thousands of Filipinos. He also designed and supported an innovative public-private partnership that uses incentive rebates to rapidly expand access to clean water to thousands of poor households in Cambodia. Currently, he oversees a diverse team of specialists working to help communities and governments become more resilient and adapt to climate change, expand access to clean water and basic sanitation, and promote sustainable and low carbon development.
