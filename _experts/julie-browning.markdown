Julie Browning joined DAI in 2018 as Director of Governance Programming for Asia, overseeing projects in Cambodia, Indonesia, Krgyzstan, and Sri Lanka. Julie began her international development career with Chemonics, spending five years in the Balkans where she worked on human rights protection and refugee affairs before transitioning to political participation and governance programming. As a democracy and governance consultant, Julie has also worked for The Asia Foundation, IRD and ARD (now TetraTech) in the Middle East and Asia but it was a her assignment with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Afghanistan, overseeing election and political party development programming in the early 2000s that convinced her to pursue work within USAIDâ€™s Washington, D.C., office where she spent more than a decade providing leadership on policy development and budgeting on behalf of USAID and technical support to missions across several regions, but with a primary focus on democracy and governance programs in Asia. Her specific areas of expertise within the governance sector includes elections, local governance and political transitions within post-conflict or backsliding countries and civil society.
