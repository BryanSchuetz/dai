Most recently, Mark served as Chief of Party of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Kenya Access to Rural Finance program, where he was recognized as an innovator in financial product design and a trusted colleague of the Central Bank of Kenya and the Ministry of Finance. As Chief of Party for the USAID-funded Kenya Microfinance Capacity Building Program, he developed approaches to build the capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and advised on improving the regulatory and policy environment for their prudent growth. Prior to that, he served as Chief of Party for the USAID-funded Georgia Microfinance Stabilization and Enhancement Program that combined legal and regulatory development with MFI performance enhancements, including agricultural finance institutions. Under a USAID cooperative agreement with FINCA International, Mark served as Chief of Party, responsible for developing a commercially viable and locally managed non-bank financial institution in Kyrgyzstan. As FINCA's Regional Director for Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States, he subsequently supervised $45 million in USAID investments in seven standalone non-bank financial institutions across the region.
