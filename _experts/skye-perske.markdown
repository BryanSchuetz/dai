Skye Perske is focused on ensuring strong links between business development and project management. Specifically, based on eight years of managing proposals across sectors and regions for DAI, she is training, mentoring, and coaching staff on how to do new business.

In her past 10 years at DAI, Skye has contributed to winning, managing, and delivering projects. She served as the Chief of Party on the AFRICOM-funded [Trans-Sahara Security Symposium](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-trans-sahara-security-symposium-tss), a civil-military operations/relations training program in North, West, and Central Africa. She then spent eight years supporting new business functions across technical areas—with a focus on governance and countering violent extremism. Skye has also managed a series of stabilization and countering violent extremism projects, including in Afghanistan, Central Asia, Kenya, the Philippines, Syria, and West Africa. Skye’s particular areas of interest include new business training and curriculum development, proposal management, and governance and stabilization programming. She speaks Arabic, French, and Italian.
