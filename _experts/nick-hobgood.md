Nick Hobgood has 30 years of experience leading complex, multisector development projects in humanitarian response, democratic initiatives, community-based natural resource management, agriculture, and small business development.
 
Son of a career U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) officer, Nick was lucky to grow up in four Latin American countries, the Ivory Coast, and Haiti, all before graduating from high school. He began his career in development in 1984 as an intern in the USAID Office of Agriculture and Rural Development in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Appreciation for diverse cultures later compelled him to join the Peace Corps, where worked in an aquaculture program in a remote village in the Bandundu Province of Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. His four years in the Peace Corps prepared him to better understand the problems faced by poor rural populations and fueled his desire to continue making a difference.
 
For the past 22 years, Nick has implemented USAID programs in conflict, post-conflict, and unpredictable environments in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Nick understands challenging contexts and has a proven capacity to deliver results under difficult circumstances. He currently oversees projects in the Middle East, including a large governance project in Iraq which works to improve local service delivery in the sectors of water, solid waste management, and electricity.
 
He has worked in Lebanon; Iraq;  the Pacific Island nations of Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Tonga; the DRC; Haiti; Timor-Leste; and Sudan. A prolific photographer, Nick is also fluent in French and Kikongo.
