Chloe Carrington is a Senior Consultant within DAI’s dedicated Center for Digital Acceleration, working across business units and donors to help integrate new technologies into development work. She has seven years of experience in the international development and nongovernmental sectors.

Chloe has hands-on experience in research into digital technologies and innovation, particularly focused on digital inclusion. She has conducted user-focused research into information access and technology use among women in rural Malawi and among small and medium businesses in southern Africa and mapped digital ecosystems in Malawi and the Western Balkans. 

Chloe’s research has recently focused on the social protection and humanitarian spaces, including the use of biometrics and other technologies in internally displaced people camps in South Sudan, the interoperability of social protection and humanitarian MIS in conflict settings, and the digitalization of payments globally.
