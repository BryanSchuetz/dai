Until January 2016, he was Chief of Party for DAI's cooperative agreement with USAID in Vietnam to implement the Persons with Disabilities Support Program (PDSP). Previously, he was Vice President and Director of the Center for Global Health Communication and Marketing at FHI 360 and AED. He also served as Director of FHI 360's PREVENT Project under USAID's global Emerging Pandemic Threats Program, which provided technical assistance in communications and behavior change to countries vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. Mark has more than 30 years of international development experience specializing in social and behavior change communication.

He was part of the AED team that pioneered modern public health communication in the early 1980s under the USAID Mass Media and Health Practices Project, developing and testing a methodology based on behavioral science and marketing principles that helped child survival programs achieve national health impact. He served as Director of USAID's worldwide Communication for Child Survival Project (HEALTHCOM), and was the Senior Behavior Change Advisor on the USAID BASICS Project (Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival). As Deputy Program Manager for USAID in Vietnam from 2000 to 2002, he helped establish the USAID office in Hanoi and oversaw a $7.5 million portfolio in health and humanitarian assistance, including programs in HIV/AIDS, disabilities, disaster mitigation, and maternal and child health. Mark has short- and long-term experience in more than 25 countries, including Afghanistan, Indonesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Russia, and Vietnam.
