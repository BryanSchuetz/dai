Nandi started out in humanitarian response as a volunteer in Mozambique after the 2000 and 2001 floods, and then continued working on humanitarian and emergency response and recovery projects in Asia and Africa. Nandi first worked for DAI as a Regional Program Manager on DAI's Sri Lanka Transition Initiatives project after the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004. Since then, Nandi has worked with international nongovernmental organizations, leading business development and funding teams in both Africa and Asia and supporting the design of projects that are both fundable, feasible to implement and ensure positive impact and benefit to the target communities. Nandi joined DAI Europe in September 2015 and is project director to the multi-country Arab Women's Enterprise Fund, East and Southern Africa Staple Food Markets and Public Procurement Initiative projects funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Commission (EC).

Her technical areas of expertise include business development, project design, and monitoring and evaluation, particularly for governance and livelihoods and economic development projects. She has worked on projects funded by the EC, the U.S. Agency for Internation Development, DFID, the Asian Development Bank, the private sector, and others.
