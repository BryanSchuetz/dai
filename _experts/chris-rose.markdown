Chris Rose is a Senior Development Specialist with DAI Europe’s Energy, Environment, and Climate Change practice. He has experience providing technical expertise on programmes funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Commission (EC), and supports business development and programme management across all donors in the fields of climate change, environment, and renewable energy.

Having cut his teeth as a project manager in the DFID Livelihoods Resource Centre in 2007, managing a number of projects, Chris now focuses on one access to energy, most notably playing a key role in the implementation of the first stage of DFID’s flagship off-grid solar focussed Energy Africa Campaign.

Over the past five years at DAI, Chris has shared his time between providing technical advice and support on the LIFE Programme—the European Union’s fund for nature, environment, and climate change—and short-term inputs on DFID and EU technical assistance projects covering areas such as emissions trading, water governance, and hydropower.
