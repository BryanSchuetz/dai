Dr. Paula Quigley is a medical doctor with more than 30 years of experience in programme management, monitoring and evaluation, and health systems strengthening. She specialises in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition. She has worked in South and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe. Currently, she is the Project Director of the Technical Assistance to Strengthen Capabilities project (TASC), which is one component under the broader Technical Assistance for Nutrition (TAN) programme of the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). She also provides technical support on the [Jalin](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-jalin) project in Indonesia, which aims to further reduce maternal and newborn mortality through partnerships with the private sector, and supports scaling up of the [MAMaZ Against Malaria](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/zambia-moblising-access-to-maternal-health-services-mamaz) project in Zambia where an innovative new product that can be administered by community health volunteers helps in the early detection and treatment of severe malaria in young children in rural areas. 

In 2017 she was the Deputy Team Leader for a global formative evaluation of UNICEF’s health systems strengthening approach, conducting country and thematic case studies. From 2014 to 2015, she was the Health Expert on the African Development Bank’s Ethiopia Flagship Study, where she reviewed innovations in Ethiopia and globally to inform potential scale-up of effective interventions across multiple sectors. As the Senior Technical Advisor to the Mobilising Access to Maternal Health Services, [Zambia (MAMaZ)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/zambia-mamaz-against-malaria) programme, she worked to address social exclusion and tackle barriers around access to maternal, newborn, and reproductive health services. She played a similar role in the follow-up programme, [MORE MAMaZ](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/zambia-more-mobilising-access-to-maternal-health-services), providing guidance on national integration and scaling up. Additionally, Paula provided oversight and technical support to the Northern Uganda programme on Improving Access to Health Care for the Poor, designing and supporting the implementation of a results-based financing model to strengthen mechanisms for improving access to, and quality of, maternal care.
