For 30 years, Jonathan Greenham has focused on identifying new options for agribusiness entrepreneurs in developing countries, improving production, increasing access to markets, and forging public-private partnerships. He has advised farmers, nonfarm rural enterprises, and agricultural processors in nearly 40 countries. Jonathan has exceptional experience in postconflict and politically volatile countries. From 2006 to 2009 he headed the [Alternative Development Programâ€”Eastern Region](/our-work/projects/afghanistan-alternative-development-programeastern-region-adpe) in Afghanistan, and from 2003 to 2005 he served as an agricultural officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Jonathan worked for more than five years in Pakistan, mainly in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and North-West Frontier Province, where he designed, evaluated, and implemented programs to provide infrastructure, inputs, and business services to locals seeking licit livelihood alternatives to poppy growing. Jonathan has hands-on experience in agricultural production as the manager of a dairy herd, a grower of vegetables for a canning company, and the manager of a private producer of high-value export crops in Kenya and Sudan, among other production and export ventures. Jonathan has consulted for the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. He previously served for 12 years in DAI's Bethesda office, including terms on DAI's Board of Directors.
