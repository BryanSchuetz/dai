Noemi Danao-Schroeder first worked internationally as a summer volunteer for a rural vaccination campaign in Paraguay. That experience kickstarted 25 years of international development work. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Noemi took a nine-month volunteer assignment in Nicaragua, eventually staying in the country for nine years. During that time she founded and led a Nicaraguan nongovernmental organization (NGO) that developed the first health and environmental education curriculum for children created for, and by, rural educators. After returning to the United States, she worked as development director for a water and reforestation NGO.

The "call abroad" came once again, and Noemi and her family moved to the cloud forest of Costa Rica where she served as Executive Director of the Monteverde Institute. During her tenure she turned the organization around from near bankruptcy to profitability in two years, and re-established the Institute as a regional leader in place-based education, applied research, and community development. A few years later Noemi joined SNV, an international development organization headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. Noemi served as country representative for Nicaragua, and then was promoted to Head of Business Development and Communications for Latin America in Quito. Noemi and her family returned to the United States in 2012 when she joined DAI on the SERVIR project.

A self-professed generalist who has worked in environment, health, water, child rights, private sector development, vocational education, value chains, renewable energy, and now Earth observations, Noemi is most passionate about making organizations and projects run smoothly and effectively.

Most recently, she served as Chief of Party for the USAID-funded Justice, Human Rights, and Security project in Honduras, a position to which she brought over 30 years of international development experience. Prior to this position, she was the Director of DAI’s Governance Portfolio, and before that Chief of Party for SERVIR, a joint initiative of NASA and USAID to advance the use of geospatial information and technology for environmental decision-making in over 30 countries.  Ms. Danao-Schroeder lived in Latin America for over 20 years, where she served as Country Director for SNV in Nicaragua; Head of Business Development and Communications for SNV Latin America, based in Ecuador; Executive Director of the Monteverde Institute in Costa Rica; and executive director/co-founder of a Nicaraguan NGO focused on children’s rights.  She is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and holds an MS in Community Development and an MBA from the University of California, Davis.  Ms. Danao-Schroeder has travelled, work, or lived in over 50 countries across Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe, and is fluent in English and Spanish with working knowledge of French, Tagalog and Ilocano.
