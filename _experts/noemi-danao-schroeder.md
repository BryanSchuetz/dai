Noemi Danao-Schroeder first worked internationally as a summer volunteer for a rural vaccination campaign in Paraguay. That experience kickstarted more than 30 years of international development work. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Noemi took a nine-month volunteer assignment in Nicaragua, eventually staying in the country for nine years. During that time she founded and led a Nicaraguan nongovernmental organization (NGO) that developed the first health and environmental education curriculum for children created for, and by, rural educators. After returning to the United States, she worked as a development director for a water and reforestation NGO.

Today, she is a Vice President at DAI, responsible for the company’s portfolio of U.S. government-funded global projects. Prior to this role, she was Senior Investment Advisor on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [INVEST](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-the-invest-project) project, which mobilized capital for development goals. Noemi has served as Chief of Party for the USAID-funded [Justice, Human Rights, and Security project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-united-for-justice) in Honduras; Director of DAI’s [Governance](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/governance) Portfolio; and Chief of Party for [SERVIR](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-servir-program-demand-activity), a global initiative of NASA and USAID to advance the use of geospatial information and technology for environmental decision-making.
