Gregg Ravenscroft is a Principal Project Manager with more than 12 years of experience negotiating the diverse challenges that come with successfully designing and implementing international, aid-funded, development projects in fragile states. His design and implementation of robust project systems and procedures ensures that project teams have a sound platform from which to conduct their activities, and identify and effectively mitigate risks in a cost-efficient manner. Underpinning his technical project management skills, is his demonstrated ability to fulfil the role of primary point of contact and key decision maker, and the gateway for information, thereby building understanding and confidence between the many stakeholders involved in project delivery. After graduating, Gregg worked for a South African-based consultancy, managing health, education, and business intelligence projects on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), and the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia. Following a period offering specialist project planning, change management and M&E advice on USAID-funded programs, Gregg spent three years as Senior Project Manager responsible for two long-term projects in Bangladesh â€“ focussing on community legal services and financial services on a poverty reduction project. Since joining DAI in 2015, Gregg has assumed responsibility for DFID-funded projects in Ghana, Mozambique, and Zambia.
