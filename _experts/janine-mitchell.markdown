Janine Mitchell is an Epidemiologist and Global Health Specialist with more than 15 years of experience and has worked in more than 30 countries. She specializes in global health security, integrated disease surveillance, health system resilience, and the application of evidence-informed decision-making. 

Janine joined DAI in 2021 after an appointment with the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), in partnership with the Hewlett Foundation to support a multi-country evidence-informed decision-making thought-leadership collaboration amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Before IDRC, Janine was a Team Leader and Senior Technical Specialist at Mott MacDonald for five years, and both led and contributed to teams on health strengthening, resilience, and One Health projects throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. More recently, she worked as the West Africa Regional Lead for the Fleming Fund, a U.K. Department of Health and Social Care initiative to apply a One Health approach to generate, share, and use data to improve antimicrobial use.

Before 2015, she worked for more than 10 years predominately in HIV and TB strategic information, health system strengthening, as well as monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and learning with the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the South African National Department of Health. Janine also partnered with the University of Johannesburg as an advisor to establish the Africa Evidence Network, which is now a community of practice of more than 3,500 multi-sectoral specialists contributing to the use of evidence in decision-making. The Africa Evidence Network is an advocate for Africaâ€™s full voice and participation in evidence-informed decision-making, and an initiative that Janine continues to support as an ally. Janine also continues to teach at the School of Health Systems and Public Health at the University of Pretoria as an Extraordinary Lecturer.
