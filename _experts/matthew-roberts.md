Matthew Roberts is a Principal Project Manager in DAI Europe's Project Management Unit, and is based full-time in Addis Ababa as General Manager. In this role he provides support to three major contracts funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) on tax, audit, and transparency, land administration, and private sector development. This role fits well with Matthew's previous position as Framework Manager of the Evidence on Demand (EoD) programme, where he built strong relationships with DFID advisors. The EoD programme, an international development information hub, provides access to quality-assured resources, sourcing individual consultants or putting together bespoke teams to match specific needs relating to climate and environment, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Since joining the company in 2005, Matthew's work has also included managing the Livelihoods Resource Centre, a programme of support services for DFID staff, a role as Deputy Programme Manager on a U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs contract to provide an emergency vaccination response in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and three years in HTSPE's dedicated European Commission Framework Unit.
