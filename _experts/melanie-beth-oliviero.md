Melanie Beth Oliviero has for 35 years worked for human rights and human development. As a strategic adviser on alliances and global business solutions at DAI, she draws on her expertise in corporate social responsibility, global philanthropy, civil society strengthening, and human rights and economic empowerment. She has designed and delivered innovative global alliances that break ground in leveraging layers of public and private donor and commercial capital to deepen impact for economic and environmental security in poor countries. This work is an extension of her affiliation with the MacArthur Foundation, where she was recruited in 1998 to help develop a philanthropic strategy responsive to new imperatives resulting from economic globalization.

>"For all the harm and injustice in the world, the resilience of the human spirit never ceases to amaze me. It is the resourcefulness, good humor, and persistence of the people I have met the world over that compel me to contribute to the cause of equality, peace, and empowerment." â€” Melanie Beth Oliviero

Melanie serves on the faculty of the New School for Social Research, teaching courses over the Internet on media in developing countries and civil society, as well as delivering seminars on international law and global corporate accountability. She has worked with different United Nations agencies and held leadership roles in several nonprofits, including the Panos Institute, which strengthens civil society through journalism; the Comparative Constitutionalism Project of the American Council of Learned Societies; and the Indian Rights Association, North America's oldest education and support organization for American Indians. Widely published, she has written on corporate social responsibility, globalization and philanthropy, and human rights. Melanie holds a Ph.D. and master's in sociolinguistics from Georgetown University.
