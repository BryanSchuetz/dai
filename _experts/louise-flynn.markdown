Louise Flynn leads DAI Sustainable Business Group’s (SBG) health, safety, security, and environment programs globally. As an environmental consultant for more than 25 years, she has managed environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and environmental safety and health impact assessments (ESHIAs) for major energy and sustainable development projects to the value of $3 million.

Louise’s work includes development of training programs on health, safety, and environment (HSE) requirements for small and medium enterprise; and management of industrial baseline surveys and workforce analyses. She redesigned an oil and gas procurement course for the ExxonMobil-funded Centre for Local Business Development in Guyana, assisting local suppliers in strengthening their understanding of procurement requirements for the oil and gas industry. With her extensive background in HSE standards, Louise also developed the curriculum for the Centre’s health, safety, and environment courses.  She develops USAID environmental monitoring and mitigation plans and training staff on their implementation.  In her health and safety role, she has led DAI’s internal response to COVID-19 by developing company-level guidelines and has supported the re-opening and operations of all our over 150 offices during the pandemic.
