Pieter de Ruijter has more than 30 years of experience in health care technology systems development, specialising in the design and development of planning and management software, and the development of computerised management and planning tools. He has worked across Africa and Asia and focusses on developing technology that functions with a minimum carbon footprint, being low on energy usage and affordable to low- and middle-income countries, keeping in mind a needs-based and context appropriate approach in his developments. 

Pieter has been extensively involved in the design and development of the software tool, Planning and Management of Assets in Health Services. He introduced this tool in Malawi for a European Union-funded initiative with the Ministry of Health, and it has also been tested in Kenya, Uganda, Nepal, and Nigeria. Pieter has worked on a programme to strengthen routine immunisation and maternal, newborn and child health programmes in Northern Nigeria.
