David Pottebaum has more than 20 years of policy, technical, program, and managerial experience in international development, focusing on social, economic, and institutional development in crisis and post-conflict settings. For more than 16 years he has led and managed recovery and reconciliation projects and operations in complex settings in Southeast and South Asia. His technical skills include the statistical analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, and applications of participatory planning and rapid assessment techniques. David recently served as Chief of Party of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Promoting Governance, Accountability, Transparency and Integrity project in Bangladesh, where he led overall program management and the design and implementation of conflict-sensitive anticorruption initiatives with local counterparts. In an environment of heightened tension, he built relationships among senior government officials, media representatives, and civil society leaders, helping them envision and work together toward a more just and better governed society. Prior to ENGAGE, he was Chief of Party for the USAID Thailand Sapan Program, and has also led long-term projects in Indonesia, Cambodia, and elsewhere. He conducted research for the World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty as a Research and Teaching Assistant at Cornell University, from where he holds a Ph.D. in applied economics. David is fluent in Thai with basic speaking ability in Khmer and Bahasa Indonesia.
