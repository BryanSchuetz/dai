Before that, Manuel was a founding partner of a financial intermediary for corporate sustainable debt products. He also co-founded, designed, fundraised, and managed an impact fund in Southeast Asia to support sustainable coastal fisheries. In this role, he also designed the Fund’s technical assistance facility, and structured and managed the Fund’s debt portfolio guarantee with the USAID Development Credit Authority (DCA), which won DCA’s 2017 Deal of the Year Award.
