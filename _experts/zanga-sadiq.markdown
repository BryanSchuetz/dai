An expert in project design and management, she works with stakeholders to identify and tailor innovative solutions that drive sustainable economic growth, building on market strategies informed by rigorous market analysis. She has managed multimillion-dollar projects funded by clients such as the U.K. Government’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC), British International Investment, the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, and private sector entities.
