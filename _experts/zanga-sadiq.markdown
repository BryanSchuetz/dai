She is experienced in strategic and commercial planning across various sectors, such as private sector development, employment promotion, entrepreneurship development, climate governance, and adaption in Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South Asia. 

As an expert in project design and management, she works with clients in identifying tailored and innovative solutions driving sustainable growth while analyzing market trends and developing market strategies for projects funded by the U.K. Governmentâ€™s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation, British International Investment (BII), Asian Development Bank, EU Delegation and the private sector.

Both programs supported inclusive entrepreneurship development of marginalized groups, where she developed strategies with local start-ups to drive transformation and sustainable growth and a COVID risk management plan to ensure business continuation.
