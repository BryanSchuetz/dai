As Project Team Director for DAI’s Center for Secure and Stable States, Christy manages a portfolio of transition, [stabilization](https://dai-global-checkpoint.com/q-and-a-complexity-aware-planning-for-stabilization-programming.html), and countering violent extremism (CVE) projects, ensuring quality programming, contractual compliance, and effective lines of communication between DAI, project teams, and donors.

Prior to her current role, she lived and worked in Asia for four years, including in Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, she served as the Deputy Chief of Party and closedown Chief of Party for the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI)’s [Reintegration and Stabilization of the East and North (RISEN)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/sri-lanka-reintegration-and-stabilization-east-and-north-risen) program, managing a team of nine and working with civil society to create space for democracy, transparency, and government accountability under an autocratic regime. 

Christy's first field assignment with DAI was as the Information Officer on the OTI/Sudan program, based first in Rumbek and then in Juba, with monitoring responsibilities for project sites throughout northern and southern Sudan for the program’s 600 in-kind grants.

She has served as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Maryland on conflict management and is fluent in Spanish.
