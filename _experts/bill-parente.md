Nearly 40 years ago, Bill Parente completed degrees in civil engineering with no intention of ever working internationally. His goal was a career with state transportation departments or the consulting firms that served them. After working as a design engineer for a Pennsylvania firm for four years, that company landed projects in Nigeria. Seeking a change of pace, Bill and his wife agreed to go to Nigeria for a two-year assignment, a project that began an odyssey for Bill of working 30 of the next 35 years overseas. Bill and Marianne lived and raised their family in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

After working as a highway engineer, rail engineer, drainage and hydrological engineer, and cost engineer, Bill transitioned to the role of project manager for the World Bank's national roads programs in Thailand, the first of numerous assignments as a project manager and chief of party on World Bank, Asian Development Bank, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Agency for International Development projects. Feeling the need to diversify his skills, Bill developed competencies in municipal engineering, engineering economics, water supply, and public-private partnerships in infrastructure.

> "In public-private partnerships, there is no substitute for a well planned, professionally designed, transparently prepared, and competitively bid infrastructure project."

In recent years, Bill has managed projects for DAI in Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Lebanon, as well as led a rural roads program in Liberia for CDM Smith.
