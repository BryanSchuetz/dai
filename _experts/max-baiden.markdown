Max worked closely with senior government advisors and DAI consortium members to run innovation projects, particularly related to disaster risk financing and social protection.

He led the design of the Collaborative Cash Delivery (CCD) Network in Ethiopia and led Save the Children’s efforts to create the infrastructure to invest in and support early-stage start-ups.
