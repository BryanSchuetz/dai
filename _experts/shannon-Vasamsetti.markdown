As a Specialist in the Climate, Land and Natural Resource practice, she supports project design, activity development and implementation of DAI’s environment projects around the world. Shannon joined DAI in 2010 and has held several positions both in the home office in project management and in the field in implementation. Previously Shannon was Deputy Chief of Party for the [Mekong Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southeast-asia-mekong-adaptation-and-resilience-climate-change-arcc) project, where she managed community and ecosystem-based agricultural adaptation and translated climate change projections and impacts for targeted users.  

She has worked in Asia, Latin America, and Africa—merging technical and operational duties to improve project management and technical direction. In addition to climate change adaptation, her technical areas of experience include ecosystem valuation, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management.
