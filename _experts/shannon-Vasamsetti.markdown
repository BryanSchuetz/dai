Shannon Vasamsetti has more than 13 years of experience working in international development at the nexus of climate change, rural livelihoods, and natural resource management. As a Senior Specialist in the Climate, Integration Team, she supports project design, activity development, and implementation of DAI projects around the world. 
Shannon joined DAI in 2010 and has held several positions both in the home office in project management and in field implementation.

Previously Shannon was Deputy Chief of Party for the the [Mekong Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southeast-asia-mekong-adaptation-and-resilience-climate-change-arcc) project, where she managed community and ecosystem-based adaptation actions across the Mekong and translated climate change projections and impacts through participatory adaptation planning with local communities.
She has worked in Asia, Latin America, and Africa—merging technical and operational duties to improve project management and technical direction. In addition to climate change adaptation, her technical areas of experience include ecosystem valuation, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management. As climate change programming has become more integrated, Shannon has worked across sector portfolios to apply a climate lens to economic growth and governance programs. Shannon now works on DAI’s Climate Integration Team to integrate climate change solutions and concepts across programs, proposals, and for cross-sectoral learning and development.
