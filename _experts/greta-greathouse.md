Describing herself as a "reformed global banker," Greta Greathouse has more than 35 years of experience innovating emerging markets and coupling the private and public sector for technology development. She has successfully engaged and firmly established public-private partnerships with global players such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, local stakeholders, and private mobile operators in challenging environments. Greta was the Chief of Party for Haiti Integrated Financing for Value Chains and Enterprises (HIFIVE), a USAID-funded project supporting information communications technology (ICT) use to expand mobile markets for financial inclusion. She led the design and implementation of multilingual ICT tools for enterprise development that reached 1.2 million Haitians. She swiftly responded to the needs of local institutions located both inside and outside of the earthquake impact zone, for support to launch 26 new mobile products addressing the needs of enterprises in to extend outreach of services in rural earthquake-affected zones. After that, she served as Chief of Party for the Cambodia Development Innovations project.

She is a three-time USAID Chief of Party and has managed teams in the midst of a natural disaster with the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Her dynamic leadership ability and response to the disaster was recognized in 2011 when she won the Global Women's Leadership Award from the World Council of Credit Unions. In her earlier career, she worked in Vietnam developing market evaluations for the World Bank.
