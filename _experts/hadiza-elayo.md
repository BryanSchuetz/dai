Hadiza is the Deputy National Programme Manager for SPARC, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)'s leading governance reform programme in Nigeria. She also leads SPARC's federal component, mandated to support the Nigeria Governors' Forum and central reform agencies such as the Millennium Development Office tasked with delivering state-level reforms. Her work entails managing state offices and government partners across the 10 states where SPARC operates, ensuring that the programme delivers on its governance reform objectives. She has successfully guided and supported the country's implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) office, resulting in the widely acclaimed Conditional Grants Scheme, Nigeria's Countdown Strategy to achieving the MDGs, and is currently involved in shaping the country's direction with plans for the Sustainable Development Goals.   

Prior to joining SPARC in 2010, she headed the Civil Service Reform Portfolio in DFID's Federal Public Service Reform Programme, which supported federal reforms through partner institutions including the Office of the Head of Service of Nigeria, Bureau of Public Service Reforms, and Office to the Secretary to Government, among others. Through her extensive knowledge on public service reforms, she has guided DFID's support to the development of The National Strategy on Public Service Reforms and the State Peer Review Mechanism.

She has more than a decade of international development experience. She began her career as a lawyer in Nigeria's National Planning Commission, after which she proceeded to the private sector, eventually becoming an independent consultant, supporting and managing reform processes such as Institutional assessments and policy development.
