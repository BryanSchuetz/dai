Prior to leading the Preparedness and Response program for the U.S. Agency for International Development, Jerry Martin was the Global Lead for the One Health & Infectious Disease practice, working at the intersection of challenges related to animal health, human health, the environment, and economic development. His major, but not exclusive, focus is on zoonotic diseases that originate in animals and become transmissible to and between humans. As the former head of the agriculture and agribusiness practices and the first managing director of DAI's Health Sector, Jerry has extensive experience creating multidisciplinary teams to address crosscutting issues such as nutrition, livelihoods for HIV-affected populations, and the impact of climate change on agriculture and health. He works on three priority areas for DAI: human health and the public health consequences of zoonotic diseases; environmental health, including climate change, affecting the spread of disease; and economic drivers that affect behaviors related to animal and human health.
