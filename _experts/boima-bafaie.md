It was in 2004, on the heels of the Second Liberian Civil War, when Boima Bafaie of Grand Cape Mount County volunteered to be an unpaid assistant for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Energy and Environment Unit. In a few months, he was fully hired by the UNDP and putting his degree in forestry to use by helping draft the "National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan" for Liberia's Environmental Protection Agency, and a career in development was born.

Boima has since become one of the most well-connected development professionals in Liberia. He joined the DAI-led Liberia Community Infrastructure Project in 2005 as a specialist in environmental standards, and became an expert in geographic information systems and monitoring and evaluation, and a manager of DAI's work in Liberia for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). "In learning USAID regulations and DAI policies, I have become extremely disciplined and have really appreciated this experience," Boima said. Now Deputy Chief of Party of the Liberia Food and Enterprise Development Program, Boima supervises direct field implementation work in six counties to build indigenous markets and capacity to increase food availability and create jobs.
