Lindsay North has more than 10 years of experience in design, research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning for peacebuilding and stabilization programs. Lindsay spent four years in Pakistan, working on research, monitoring and evaluation, and countering violent extremism programming. She then joined the DAI team in Bethesda, where she has had long-term engagement on peacebuilding and resilience programming and research in countries such as the Caribbean, Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria. She has expertise in conflict analysis, complexity-aware monitoring, evaluation, and learning; conflict sensitivity; strategic communications; trauma-informed program design; and conducting research in closed and closing spaces.

In addition to her experience as an implementer, Lindsay has supported and authored numerous assessments for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on democracy, governance, stabilization, and extremism in countries across the Middle East and Asia, in addition to designing and supporting training for USAID and State Department officials in democracy, rights, and governance principles and countering violent extremism in West Africa.
