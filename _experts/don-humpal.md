Don Humpal works with DAI’s public, private, and foundation clients and partners to translate agricultural know-how into economic value, food security, food safety, and improved nutrition in a wide range of frontier and emerging market countries. He applies experience from 35 years of work with researchers, seed and input suppliers, farmers, marketers, processors, wholesalers and retailers to identify and apply best-bet solutions all along the farm-to-plate value chains in fruits and vegetables, cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. He leads teams designing and delivering complex, integrated agriculture and water resource development strategies and programs. Don is a former member of DAI’s Board of Directors and past-Trustee of the DAI ESOP.
