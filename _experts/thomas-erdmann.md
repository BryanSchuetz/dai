Thomas Erdmann specializes in natural resources management. A trained forester, he offers expertise in community forestry, agroforesty, ecoregional or landscape-scale conservation and development, conservation forestry, and land use planning. Thomas has worked for 17 years in developing countries, most recently in Madagascar (2004 to 2009), where he managed one of two regional programs for the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Eco-Regional Initiatives to Promote Alternatives to Slash & Burn Practices, a project centered on community-based forest management and agricultural intensification and diversification. In this position, he supervised 20 Malagasy technical and administrative staff and was responsible for the ecoregional conservation and development component of the project. Thomas' previous overseas experience includes assignments in Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, and Rwanda.
