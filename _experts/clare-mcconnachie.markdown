Clare McConnachie is the Chief of Party of the [Countering Violent Extremism in Central Asia (CVECA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/central-asia-support-for-stable-societies-casss) Activity, and brings 24 years of experience managing, implementing, and monitoring community-based social and political stabilization programs, including more than seven years leading projects in Afghanistan, Burma, Central Asia, and Sri Lanka. On the [Promote: Musharikat project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-musharikat), she oversaw the development of issue-based advocacy campaigns and provided technical input to, and oversight of, small grant applications. Prior to this, she led the [Afghanistan Stabilization in Key Areas-North (SIKA-N)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-stability-key-areas-north-sika-north) project, overseeing the implementation and close out of more than 300 small grants that focused on improving stability by eliminating drivers of conflict through building confidence and trust between communities and local authorities. 

Before Afghanistan, Clare led a project in Burma, where she worked to support the nascent political transition and empower local partners to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change. She also led two successive projects in Sri Lanka: Reintegration and Stabilization in the East (RISE) and the subsequent [Reintegration and Stabilization in the East and the North (RISEN)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/sri-lanka-reintegration-and-stabilization-east-and-north-risen). Previously, Clare was the Regional Program Manager on the [Sri Lanka Transition Initiative (SLTI)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/sri-lanka-transition-initiatives-project-slti), where she adapted programming to the fluctuating political situation exacerbated after the 2004 tsunami. She also worked to coordinate the initial response to the 2004 tsunami for the United Nations Development Program, as a Field Coordinator for the Sri Lanka Transition Program.
