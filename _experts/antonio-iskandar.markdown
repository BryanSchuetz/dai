Antonio Iskandar’s interest in public affairs, government, and public policy started early in his career when he worked as Director of Municipal Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior, where he was tasked with mediating and coordinating security, elected officials, and citizen organizations to generate security agendas in the city of Caracas. His job was to analyze complex governance issues that impacted governance in his native Venezuela. Twenty years later, he has worked in more than 15 countries designing and implementing democracy and governance programs with emphasis on local governance, decentralization, anticorruption, and citizen security.
 
He has led the implementation of several complex U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded projects in Albania, Bolivia, Macedonia, and most recently, Mexico; conducted short-term technical assessments; and championed several winning proposals.
 
Inspired by the success of his last assignment leading the USAID Crime and Violence Prevention program in Mexico, he returned to DAI in September 2016, after 15 years, to build the Citizen Security Practice under the Governance Sector. In that role, Antonio is leading DAI’s efforts to position in the Citizen Security area by supporting business development efforts, the generation of knowledge and technical products, and the successful implementation of projects within that practice.
