Alyssa Menz is a Senior Analyst in DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) specializing in local content and global supply chain development. During her SBG tenure, she has worked on projects related to corporate and government local content strategy development, local content policy analysis, government engagement, local content reporting, tracking, and quantitative analysis, industrial baseline studies, and corporate social investment initiatives. Alyssa is the DAI SBG technical lead for the Mexico Foreign Commonwealth Office Energy Strand Programme, a four-year project funded by the U.K. government aimed at generating inclusive, socio-economic growth in Mexico’s energy sector and transitioning Mexico to a low-carbon economy. Alyssa also oversees development and roll-out of the DAI Local Content Masterclass, a three-day course geared at enabling operators, contractors, and government to leverage local content in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes risk. She has co-taught the Local Content Masterclass in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, United Kingdom, and United States. Alyssa is a lead analyst for two DAI local content quantitative tools: the DAI Local Content Plan and Reporting Platform (LCPR)—an online tool for local content reporting, tracking and monitoring across procurement, workforce, and capacity development—and the DAI Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM)—an online tool that forecasts baseline and maximum local content within suppliers and workforce across supply chains. 
 
Prior to DAI, Alyssa worked with Synergy Global, an international sustainability consulting firm specializing in social impact and risk assessment, community relations management, social baseline studies, and community benefit creation.
