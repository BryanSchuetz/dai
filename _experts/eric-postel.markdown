Eric Postel is a development industry leader with a distinguished record both as a public servant and as a private sector executive focused on emerging and frontier markets. His wide-ranging career encompasses pioneering work in development finance, impact investing, clean energy, and trade and investment facilitation, among other achievements, and spans more than 70 countries.

At DAI, Eric works with DAI’s clients and stakeholders at the highest level, develops and supports the execution of our strategy in particular countries and technical areas, and works on development projects around the world.

After working in the private sector for more than 25 years, Eric was asked to serve in senior leadership positions with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2011 to 2017 in order to help improve development effectiveness. In the final two years of his tenure, as Associate Administrator, he took on the interim role of Acting Deputy Administrator. 

As Assistant Administrator for the Africa Bureau (2014–2015), he led agency operations in Africa, notably including creation of the Bureau’s Ebola Unit, which managed USAID recovery efforts in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, and supervision of Power Africa—the U.S. Government’s initiative, of which he was one of the designers, to support private sector clean energy projects that expand access to electricity on the continent.  

As Assistant Administrator for the Economic Growth, Education, and Environment (E3) Bureau—a position he held throughout his time at USAID—Eric led an organization that provided technical leadership to 100 USAID offices across 14 subject matter areas. He particularly championed domestic resource mobilization as a means of assisting developing nations on their journey to self-reliance, and he played a key role, accordingly, in adoption of the Addis Tax Initiative.

Eric’s private sector experience includes serving for more than 20 years as a Senior Partner at Pangaea Partners, a Madison, Wisconsin-based company he founded to provide investment banking and financial consulting services in emerging markets; as Director of Venture Investments for CleanTech Partners, which provided capital to inventors of clean energy technologies; as the CFO of Infigen, a biotech company;  and as a Vice President of Citibank in Tokyo and New York. 

In 2006, Eric was appointed by the U.S. Senate to the Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People Around the Globe (HELP) Commission, whose landmark 2007 report developed recommendations for improving U.S. foreign assistance. He also chaired the Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee for the U.S. Export–Import Bank from 1999 to 2000.

Eric was an officer for four years in the U.S. Navy.
