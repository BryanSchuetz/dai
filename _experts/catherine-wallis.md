Catherine Wallis spent her life switching countries from a very early start, which set the path for learning about different cultures and languages. As a trained agricultural engineer in the traditional intensive farming systems of France, she decided to learn about other models and fell into international development. An internship in Gujarat in the aftermath of the 2001 earthquake got her working with logframes and community-based disaster rehabilitation. She has been working for international development consultancies in the United Kingdom and in France for the past 13 years.

Her technical areas of expertise include: rural livelihoods, natural resource management, social protection, environmental management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. She has led several project design and evaluation assignments. She enjoys managing projects and has been doing so with the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), European Commission (EC), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Danida, Swiss development agency, French local government, the private sector, and others.

Catherine is bilingual French and English, with good command of Spanish and German. She first joined HTSPE in 2003 as a project coordinator and is delighted to be back with the DAI family 10 years on.
