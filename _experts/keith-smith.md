A former aircraft engineer, Keith is an experienced development professional who has worked over the past 15 years in Africa, Asia, and Europe. He has managed a range of development programmes focused on infrastructure, agriculture, health, reintegration of ex-combatants, grants management, and governance. His strengths are in team leadership and programme management, both at the field and corporate level. Within DAI he initially worked as Economic Integration Manager on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Liberia Community Infrastructure Programme, where he eventually served as Deputy Chief of Party and acting Chief of Party. From there he moved to be Regional Programme Manager for a USAID Sri Lankan community infrastructure programme, supporting the peace process and tsunami recovery. In 2008, he became Chief of Party on USAID's Federally Administered Tribal Areas Capacity Building Programme before, in 2010, moving back to the United Kingdom to be DAI's technical advisor in the areas of post conflict and project management. Building on his field experience in challenging environments, Keith currently has overall responsibility for the U.K. Department for International Development-funded Transforming Education project in Pakistan; Support to FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreement in Liberia; Land Investment Transformation Programme in Ethiopia; and the M&E, Environmental and Social Management/Maintenance of Roads in DRC Phase II.
