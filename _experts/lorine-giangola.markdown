Lorine Giangola specializes in natural resources management and climate change adaptation, with a focus on agroecosystems. She has extensive experience engaging and building the capacity of diverse stakeholders, including women and indigenous groups, in natural resources and climate adaptation decision processes, with on-the-ground technical work in Asia, the Caribbean, South America, the United States, and West Africa.

In DAI’s Climate Change and Natural Resources Management Practice, Lorine contributes to business development and provides technical assistance to integrate climate adaptation and gender equality into natural resources development programming.
 
Lorine originally trained as a landscape and conservation ecologist, but her interest in the complex decision-making processes related to managing natural resources and ecosystems for multiple goals—environmental quality, food production, economic development, public health, cultural preservation, recreation—led her to study context-sensitive and problem-oriented policy analysis in graduate school.
 
Lorine conducted her doctoral research in the U.S. agricultural system and developed and demonstrated an interdisciplinary method to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing incentives for agricultural conservation practice adoption to improve water quality. She worked closely with farmers, conservation organizations, academic researchers, and federal, state, and local natural resources agencies.
 
Prior to joining DAI, she worked at Stratus Consulting and Abt Associates, where she managed and led technical work for donor-funded climate adaptation projects around the world, and helped build governments’ capacity to manage natural resources and economic development as climate impacts become more frequent and intense. She also led and worked as a technical expert on natural resources restoration projects for Native American Tribes and U.S. federal and state agencies.
