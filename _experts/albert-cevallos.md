Over his career, he has received numerous awards for his work, including four Superior Group Honor Awards presented by the U.S. Government, a United Nations Association Human Rights Community Award, and a Senior Fellowship at the U.S. Institute of Peace, for whom he just completed a book analyzing the democratization of Serbia and how this could apply to other repressive regimes.
