David Hall has more than 10 years of experience designing, implementing, and managing donor-funded public financial management and fiscal transparency programs. David has contributed to or led in-country technical design efforts for DAI in Armenia, Colombia, El Salvador, Georgia, Jordan, Maldives, Peru, South Somalia, and Sudan. As a contributing expert to the [Public Expenditure Perspectives](https://assetify-dai.com/news/PEP-Pages.pdf) publication in Jordan, David evaluated productivity statistics across sub-national government units to identify allocative inefficiencies within the Jordanian public health system. He has conducted systematic programmatic evaluations of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s flagship [Domestic Resource Mobilization](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-domestic-resource-mobilization-program) project in El Salvador, and the recently completed [Fiscal and Procurement Reform Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guatemala-fiscal-and-procurement-reform-project-fprp) in Guatemala—in both cases he contributed technical and management analysis to the projects’ learning agenda. Prior to that, he served as Acting Deputy Chief of Party on an anti-corruption project in Bangladesh.
