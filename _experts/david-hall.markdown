David has contributed to or led in-country technical design efforts for DAI in Armenia, Colombia, El Salvador, Georgia, Jordan, Maldives, Peru, South Somalia, and Sudan. As a contributing expert to the Public Expenditure Perspectives publication in Jordan, David evaluated productivity statistics across sub-national government units to identify allocative inefficiencies within the Jordanian public health system.
