Ian Rose, a lawyer specializing in land tenure, property rights, and access to justice, has led long-term projects in Cabo Verde, Colombia, Lebanon, Mozambique. Most recently, he was team leader for our property rights registration and cadaster services project in [Cabo Verde,](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/public-private-partnerships-for-land-administration-can-it-work-in-cabo-verde/) funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). In Mozambique, he led DAI’s land tenure registration project from 2011 to 2013, a program credited with pioneering women’s land rights in that country. Ian combines a legal background with a practical vision of project management geared to achieve results in challenging environments. In Colombia and Lebanon, Ian was chief of party for projects funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), working in post-conflict environments (sometimes erupting into conflict) that sought to improve access to justice, consolidate democratic gains, and bolster civil society. He began his work in international development working directly for USAID as a democracy and governance officer in Ghana.
