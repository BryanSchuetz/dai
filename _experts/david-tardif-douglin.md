David Tardif-Douglin runs Africa Lead II, a project that builds the capacity of agriculture professionals, institutions and stakeholders to position African leaders and institutions at the forefront of increased agricultural productivity and food security.

It was a high school politics and economics class 37 years ago that sparked David's interest in economic development. The son of American missionaries in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), David, who was born and raised in the turbulent country, saw the effects of poverty all around him, as well as how things could be on his infrequent trips back to the United States and Europe. He also gained an appreciation for different paths toward economic progress while traveling to and from school through Zaire, Uganda, and Kenya.

Wanting to learn more about the process of economic and social development, David went to the United States to attend college, earning a degree in economics and business. He returned to Zaire and ran a cattle ranch for two years before heading back to America for graduate studies in agricultural economics. Upon completing his doctoral degree, David joined DAI and was promptly assigned to long-term work in Rwanda and, later, the Philippines.

> "To be able to do our small part in improving the capacity of African champions for agriculture is really exciting." â€” David Tardif-Douglin

An agricultural economist with expertise in capacity building, training, and managing and overseeing multiple technical teams operating in multiple project sites, David most recently managed a global project that trained and prepared veterinarians, public health personnel, farmers, and government officials to prepare for and counter avian influenza and pandemic outbreaks. David has also supported DAI projects in Azerbaijan, El Salvador, and Nigeria.
