John, a Principal Consultant in our land team, has 14 years of international project experience in the land, natural resources, and environment sectors in Europe, Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and South America. During this time he has worked for a diverse range of clients, including the U.K. Department for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the European Commission, the Pan American Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNHCR, the U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and various nonprofits.

His training in land use planning and extensive experience in land registration projects give John a sound understanding of land governance issues. John has expertise in land tenure regularisation (LTR), land administration, geographic information systems (GIS), and participatory tenure and resource mapping, including the use of "crowd-sourcing" techniques.

Most recently, John worked as a Senior LTR Advisor in Rwanda on the award-winning Land Tenure Regularisation Support Programme, where he established a large GIS and map production department, introducing open source GIS tools for the systematic processing of cadastral data. He currently leads DAI Europe's Land Governance Practice, and provides technical inputs as the Systematic Registration Advisor on the DFID-funded Land Investment for Transformation programme in Ethiopia.
