Patricia Sturgess has a unique background that combines more than 11 years of experience in the private, public and voluntary sectors, with expertise in livelihoods, aid management, international relations and security, and political analysis. With a long-standing interest in international and community development, she has volunteered in Latin America with Global Vision International and with several organisations in the United Kingdom. Having joined the DAI (formerly HTSPE) Business Development team in 2012, Patricia is now Principal Consultant within the Technical Services team in DAI Europe, focusing on livelihoods. She has successfully completed a range of paid consultancy assignments for the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) (through Evidence on Demand) and the World Bank (a researcher for the Mid-Term Review of the MENA Transition Fund). During her tenure with DAI, benefitting from seven years of experience as a government analyst, she has been involved in multiple aspects of proposal development for donor-funded projects (DFID, European Commission, AusAID/DFAT, World Bank), including developing technical content and commercial offers. An accomplished writer, Patricia has authored numerous reports, learning guides and promotional materials. She also contributed to early drafts of the strategic business case for DFID's Land Investment for Transformation Programme in Ethiopia.
