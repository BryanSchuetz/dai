Patrick Henry is the Vice President of DAI’s Sustainable Business Group, which supports corporations in developing inclusive supply chains and impactful social investment. He leads DAI’s work with multinational corporate clients. 
 
Patrick’s expertise encompasses a wide range of technical areas, including supplier development, local content, agriculture and aquaculture, global logistics and supply chains, investor relations, corporate social responsibility, communications campaigns, and national policy development. His work focuses on bridging the gap between the supply chain demands of multinational companies and the ability of local suppliers to excel and secure contracts.  
 
Patrick’s approach to supplier development is driven by rigorous supply chain analytics and modeling that address the needs of local businesses. In Guyana, for ExxonMobil, Patrick led the Centre for Local Business Development from inception to sustained results in moving hundreds of suppliers through a pioneering program that resulted in them winning work and building long-term capacity to support the nascent energy sector. In Mozambique, he conceptualized a novel model of blending international best practices with local expertise for supplier development through a newly created local enterprise. 
 
Before joining DAI, Patrick held senior executive and entrepreneurial roles, notably driving an agricultural investment from conception to successful capital raising and production.
