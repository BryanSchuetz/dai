Miroslav Levanic is the Chief of Party for the [Afghanistan Competitiveness of Export-Oriented Business Activity (ACEBA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-competitiveness-of-export-oriented-businesses-aceba). This program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, supports export-oriented businesses in Afghanistan through technical assistance, grants, and business-enabling environment activities to improve access to finance and facilitate exports.
 
With more than 20 years of experience in the field of international development, in addition to his current role with ACEBA, Miroslav has managed core program operational functions for prominent USAID-funded programs in Afghanistan, such as [Afghanistan Small and Medium Enterprise Development (ASMED)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-small-and-medium-enterprise-development-asmed), [Assistance in Building Afghanistan by Developing Enterprises (ABADE)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-assistance-building-afghanistan-development-enterprise-abade), and [PROMOTE Women in the Economy (WIE)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-women-in-the-economy). On each of these occasions, Miroslav was tasked with overseeing the implementation of grants and worked to build capacity of grantees, enterprises, and project staff to manage grants compliantly.
 
Miroslav's journey in international development began in 2002 when he joined the American Refugee Committee in Croatia. He joined DAI in early 2005 and worked on the Enhancing Small and Medium Enterprise Performance Project. After a period in the private sector, he returned to DAI in 2009, reaffirming his commitment to international development. Miroslav has since risen to his current position.
