Since October 2015 he has served as Deputy Chief of Party for the Coastal Community Adaptation Project (C-CAP), a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) four-year initiative to support climate change adaptation and disaster risk management in nine Pacific Island countries. He leads project communications and operations and supports technical implementation with a focus on training and capacity-building activities.

His Pacific Islands experience dates to 2005 when he served as a Peace Corps Volunteer for three years in the Kingdom of Tonga.
