He is currently the Chief of Party on the [Mozambique Local Governance Strengthening (LOGOS)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-local-governance-strengthening-logos) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, where he leads efforts to strengthen subnational governance and service delivery in the health, education, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sectors in the Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and Zamb√©zia provinces. Prior to this, Silvestre worked in key leadership roles with DAI to support northern communities adapting in the face of rising extremism in northern Mozambique. He identified and developed activities to improve trust between government and communities through community-level interventions as Senior Program Manager of USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives Mozambique Community Resilience Program (MCRP) and directed the implementation of an integrated approach based on municipal governance, participatory budgeting, engagement with citizens, media coverage, and public debate in five major cities in Mozambique (Maputo, Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Tete), as Team Leader of the [Democratic Support Governance Program (DIALOGO)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-democratic-governance-support-programme-dgsp). Before joining DAI, Silvestre was a Program Director for IBIS-Denmark in Mozambique, leading an effort to strengthen local governance in the remote northern province of Niassa.
