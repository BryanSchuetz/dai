Phelps Feeley is Chief of Party for the [Youth Resilience to Crime and Violence in the Caribbean Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-youth-resilience-to-crime-and-violence-in-the-caribbean-activity), in Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. The activity's risk reduction programming represents an evidence-based approach to supporting youth at-risk and addressing multifaceted challenges. Grounded in the public health approach to crime and violence prevention, trauma-informed care, positive youth development, and community engagement, the activity seeks to mitigate risk factors that lead to negative outcomes. As a four-time Chief of Party and two-time Deputy Chief of Party, Phelps brings more than 15 years of experience supporting empowered teams to effectively and positively impact crime and violence prevention, responsive governance at the national and subnational levels, democratic political transitions, and European Union ascension, strengthening of independent media, and civil society mobilization in the Caribbean, Central and South Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Currently, she and her family enjoy living, working, hiking, swimming, and being part of community life in Saint Lucia.
