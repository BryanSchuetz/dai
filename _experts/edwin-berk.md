Edwin Berk has built his career at the intersection of the public and private sectors. After a brief teaching stint at Yale University, he joined a Washington, D.C., public policy consulting firm. When that firm grew into a global engineering and construction company, he shifted to capturing new engineering projects in international markets, while posted in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Because his targeted markets were mainly developing countries, he typically had to structure the projects and secure their financing to produce genuine opportunities for revenue-generating business. Ed joined DAI in 2004 to manage and write larger, high-priority proposals. In 2012, he was posted to Amman, Jordan, to develop business in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In 2014 he returned to DAI’s U.S. headquarters to continue identifying and positioning for donor-funded project opportunities in the MENA region as well as Afghanistan. Now he oversees business development operations for DAI’s U.S. Government business unit while continuing to lead high-priority bids worldwide.
