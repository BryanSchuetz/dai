summary: |
  The novel coronavirus has had a profound public health impact in the developed
  world and is poised to have an equally if not more devastating effect on developing
  nations. As travel bans, lockdowns, and stalled trade take an increasing toll, economic
  spillover effects—and associated social instability—threaten to compound the crisis,
  especially in some of the world’s more vulnerable and fragile states.
