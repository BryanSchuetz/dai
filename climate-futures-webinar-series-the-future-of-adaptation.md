# Climate Futures Webinar Series: The Future of Adaptation

In this first event in DAI’s Climate Futures Webinar series—The Future of Adaptation—our Global Climate Director Donald Lunan explored practical examples of adaptation emerging from projects around the world. 

The webinar explored [six areas](/uploads/climate-flyer-2021.pdf) that need to be addressed for climate adaptation measures to be effective and sustainable: governance; inclusion; integration; climate services; finance; and knowledge and learning. The panelists shared their experience and observations from the field concerning these areas.
