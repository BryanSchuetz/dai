**Description**: With more than 60% of Africa’s population (and over 80% in some countries) depending on small or micro-scale farming as their primary source of livelihood, enhancing the resilience and sustainability of agrifood systems should be a priority to build back better in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. Yet, agriculture in Africa receives less than 3% of banking credit and account for less than 3% of Africa governments’ expenditure.  

This session will explore how to effectively finance the diversification and upgrading of agriculture along sustainable and resilient agri value chains in an inclusive manner, potential innovative mechanism to help financiers partnering along sustainable value chains and how they be supported.
