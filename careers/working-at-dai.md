Pioneering international <br class="hidden-xs">development. 
</h1>
<div class="copy">

<p>Founded by three graduates of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government in 1970, DAI was built on the premise that international development could be done differently… and better. That entrepreneurial and innovative spirit earned DAI a reputation as an international development pioneer.</p>
<p>We continue to be a forward-looking company — one that combines creative thinking, deep technical knowledge, and adroit project management. We remain as passionate, committed, and open-minded today as we were when we first opened our doors. Our multicultural, multilingual, and multidisciplinary team of more than 3,000 professionals continues to embrace opportunities to solve new problems, no matter how complex or challenging.</p>
