<p>DAI project teams address global challenges using a cross-disciplinary approach. In more than 160 countries, spanning six continents, our long-term project outcomes have helped change the world for the better.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Indonesia:</strong> We connected 2.5 million people to safe water, improved sanitation for more than 300,000, and reduced water costs for low-income households by 57 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Vietnam:</strong> We helped the government transform its trade competitiveness to become an export powerhouse and a magnet for foreign investment, reducing poverty from 60 to 20 percent.</p>
<p><strong>El Salvador:</strong> For an investment of a few million dollars over seven years, we helped mobilize $300 million annually in additional tax revenue, without raising tax rates.</p>
<p><strong>Rwanda:</strong> We provided land titles for the entire country for the first time ever—10.3 million parcels—at a previously unheard of low cost of $7 per title (previous low in Africa: $69).</p>
<p>Nothing makes us prouder than the impact we’ve made and continue to make. Learn more about both our active and completed projects.</p>
