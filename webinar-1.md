**Description:** Micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are dramatically affected by the coronavirus pandemic all over the world. The crisis has revealed their vulnerability to the supply and demand side, and as per a recent OECD paper, there is a serious risk that more than 50 percent of them will not survive the next few months. 

In low-income countries, formal and informal MSMEs are significant engines of growth, employment, innovation, and social development. This webinar will showcase public and private sector initiatives to support MSMEs in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, and discuss how governments and development partners could further engage with the private sector to pave the way to a quicker and environmentally sustainable economy recovery in developing countries.
