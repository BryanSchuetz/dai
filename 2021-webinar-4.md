**Description**: Following the initial crisis response policies aimed at mitigating the most immediate and
pressing challenges, governments and international organisations are developing policy and
investment packages to shape the long-term recovery from the crisis. There are strong calls
for these packages to stimulate a “green recovery” in line with the spirit of the EU Green
Deal.

This panel will discuss emerging approaches to support a global green and resilient
recovery from a policy and a finance perspective.
