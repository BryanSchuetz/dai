Financial institutions for development play a major role in the COVID-19 recovery. But for development finance to be truly effective, it must go beyond a simple deal culture and be integrated in more comprehensive approaches, combined with other development cooperation instruments and modalities, including policy and multi-stakeholder dialogues, and anchored in local dynamics and realities.How can development finance best be integrated into recovery efforts by local actors and donors? How can it contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic transformation? How can it best be tailored to reach out to MSMEs and informal work in riskier countries? What role can the EU and its Team Europe approach play in stimulating transformative, sustainable, green, inclusive and gender-sensitive investment?
