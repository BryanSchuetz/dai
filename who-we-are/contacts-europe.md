summary: The European Union (EU) is the world’s largest development donor. DAI, with
  its long-term presence on the European continent and the recent acquisition of Human
  Dynamics, is a key partner in the implementation of the EU global strategy for international
  development and cooperation. As the leading EU contractor, we seek to build synergies
  between EU policies to the benefit of partner countries.
