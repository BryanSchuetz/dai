In Oman, DAI has supported clients including Shell, Occidental Petroleum Oman, Khimji Ramdas Group, and government ministries including Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion, Health, and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). 

Our work has focused on providing advisory and implementation services in corporate social investment (CSI) and in-country value (ICV). PDO defines ICV as “the total spends retained in country that benefits business development, contributes to human capability development and stimulates productivity in Oman’s economy.”

To boost the oil and gas industry’s contribution to the broader socioeconomic development of the Sultanate, the government in 2018 introduced an ambitious plan to introduce ICV across all sectors.

Oman’s focus on local content and ICV has stimulated demand for adaptive professionals to implement rapidly evolving local content compliance regimes and deliver tangible local benefits as a balance to globalization.

DAI’s [Local Content Masterclass](https://preview-dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable/training/master-class) meets that need by bringing together participants from the private and public sectors, helping them balance the commercial realities of volatile global demand and sustained cost pressures with the current political momentum for increased local content. DAI draws on more than 2,000 long-term projects and development assignments completed across 150 countries to advance participants’ skills.

DAI is a trusted advisor on corporate sustainability to companies around the world. We design CSI strategies to align with international best practices and standards including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ISO 26000 guidance on social responsibility, and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) according to the needs and interests of the client.
