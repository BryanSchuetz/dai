With offices in Apsley, Hertfordshire and in London, our U.K.-based team delivers results for bilateral and multilateral donors, governments, and private sector clients worldwide, often in difficult environments racked by insecurity and conflict. We work hand in hand with our counterparts in government and the private sector to identify where international best practices can be usefully applied and best tailored to the local context.

Our work is underpinned by decades of experience and proven methodologies in areas as diverse as public sector reform, trade and economic development, finance and microfinance, support to the land sector, food security and safety nets, climate change adaptation, crisis mitigation and recovery, and Making Markets Work for the Poor.

DAI employs superior technical and managerial practitioners and consultants worldwide. Our project management systems have demonstrated their effectiveness in the world’s largest development projects, so we can manage complex risks and mobilise a wide range of resources quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively. As the European platform for DAI, operating in tandem with our Brussels office, DAI Europe integrates a broad range of development and transition consulting expertise.

For more than 50 years, the true measure of our success has been the success of others and the continued benefit resulting from our work long after project completion. We design and implement every project with this result as our goal.

## Office Contacts
