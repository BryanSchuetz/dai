# Our Solutions
 
DAI’s work covers EU traditional cooperation sectors such as governance, sustainable agriculture, economic growth, and education, but also offers innovative approaches to the EU’s pressing priorities on migration, resilience, digitalisation, climate change, private sector engagement and investment, and global health—in addition to new challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis. 

## COVID-19

DAI supports the [EU’s global response to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/system/files/joint-comm-2020-eu-global-response_en.pdf) and has leveraged its in-house expertise and multiclient experience to share knowledge and identify innovative solutions to the global COVID-19 crisis.

  <h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Democratic Governance</strong></p>
  
  <p>We support the rule of law by building citizens’ ability to demand better governance through oversight mechanisms,
    civic education, civil society strengthening, and legal assistance. We help build mechanisms to fight corruption and
    promote democracy and human rights.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Public Administration Reform</strong></p>
  
  <p>DAI assists governments to keep pace with change in the ﬁelds of justice and home affairs by designing and
    implementing public administration reform, legal reform, and good governance programmes that lead to more effective,
    transparent, and responsive civil service and criminal justice systems. These initiatives include institutional and
    legislative reform as well as training for members of the public sector, together with associated infrastructure
    improvements such as improved IT.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Public Finance Management</strong></p>
  
  <p>We work with governments to implement rigorous cost control and revenue mobilization programmes—including effective
    national statistics systems—and help countries make the sometimes difﬁcult choices needed to achieve inclusive
    economic growth while ensuring that essential public services (such as health and education) are sustained.</p>

## Economic Growth

**Sustainable Agriculture**

We help communities, nations, and regions address food insecurity by championing solutions that lead to resilient and sustainable livelihoods—increasing agricultural productivity and production, expanding opportunities to boost and diversify incomes, and promoting socially and economically responsible safety nets.
 
**Trade and Private Sector Engagement**

DAI works in line with the External Investment Plan for private sector engagement and investment and has an inclusive approach to development, working with donors, businesses, investors, and governments.

    and engaging stakeholders. We address the need for teaching skills and legislative frameworks that enable all children
    and adults to beneﬁt from the power of education and bridge the traditional facets of education with the new demands
    of the digital age. We have extensive experience supporting TVET and youth entrepreneurship programmes, and
    integrating such programmes in broader economic development agendas.</p>

## Crosscutting Sectors

**Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment** 

DAI applies a gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) approach to integrate gender considerations across all our services and sectors: design, research, monitoring and evaluation, assessments, and implementation—as well as in the staffing of projects. Our Gender Working Group brings together DAI’s latest thinking and develops crosscutting solutions integrating all these sectors.

**Fragility and Migration** 

DAI’s work is in line with the European Consensus for Development and the EU’s efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement. We work in complex and fragile environments to strengthen resilience against environmental and economic shocks. Our Center for Secure and Stable States is tasked with ensuring technical and operational excellence for all our development and governance work in fragile states.
