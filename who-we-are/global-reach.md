## European Union

DAI has long had a presence in continental Europe. With the [acquisition](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-acquires-leading-european-development-consultancy-human-dynamics) of the distinguished European development consultancy [Human Dynamics](https://www.humandynamics.org/) in 2019, we achieved the scale and technical breadth that enables us to offer richer services and better value to our customers in the European Union. We also became the largest single provider of development services to the European Commission.

## Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and largest economy, a country of almost unimaginable promise. But like many emerging nations it faces the development challenges that come with industrialization and growth. With offices in Lagos and Abuja, our extensive in-country team works with public and private sector clients to realize Nigeria's extrordinary potential.

## United States

From its earliest days as a start-up in 1970, DAI has maintained a presence in or near Washington, D.C. The three founders’ office was a tiny establishment in Georgetown. Today, our office in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, is home to some 350 employees.
