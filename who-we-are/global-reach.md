## European Union

The European Union (EU) is the world’s largest development donor. DAI, with its long-term presence on the European continent and the acquisition of Human Dynamics, is a key partner in the implementation of the EU global strategy for international development and cooperation. As the leading EU contractor, we seek to build synergies between EU policies to the benefit of partner countries.

## Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and largest economy, a country of almost unimaginable promise. But like many emerging nations it faces the development challenges that come with industrialization and growth. With an office in Abuja, our extensive in-country team works with public and private sector clients to realize Nigeria's extraordinary potential.

## Pakistan

Home to almost a quarter of a billion people at the crossroads of Central Asia, the Asian Subcontinent, and the Gulf, Pakistan is both a rapidly growing economy and a perennial geopolitical hotspot, given its borders with Afghanistan, China, India, and Iran. DAI brings to Pakistan its global perspective, resources, and expertise, and a locally-led team of world class professionals based in Islamabad.

## United States

From its earliest days as a start-up in 1970, DAI has maintained a presence in or near Washington, D.C. The three founders’ office was a tiny establishment in Georgetown. Today, our office in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, is home to some 350 employees.
