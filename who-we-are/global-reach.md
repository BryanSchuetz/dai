## Brussels

DAI has long had a project presence in the European capital and in 2016 we established a formal corporate office, bringing us closer to our clients in the European Commission and elsewhere on the continent. The Brussels team of programme managers and technical staff focuses on business development, project management, and client relations, and is tightly integrated into DAI’s global organization, tapping the full range of technical specialists and support staff from our U.S., U.K., and other operations.

## Nigeria

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and largest economy, a country of almost unimaginable promise. But like many emerging nations it faces the development challenges that come with industrialization and growth. With offices in Lagos and Abuja, our extensive in-country team works with public and private sector clients to realize Nigeria's extrordinary potential.

## United Kingdom

With offices in Apsley, Hertfordshire, and in London, our U.K.-based team delivers results for bilateral and multilateral donors, governments, and private sector clients worldwide, often in difficult environments racked by insecurity and conflict.

## United States

From its earliest days as a start-up in 1970, DAI has maintained a presence in or near Washington, D.C. The three founders’ office was a tiny establishment in Georgetown. Today, our office in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, is home to some 350 employees.
