# Brussels

DAI has long had a project presence in the European capital and in 2016 we established a formal corporate office, bringing us closer to our clients in the European Commission and elsewhere on the continent. The Brussels team of programme managers and technical staff focuses on business development, project management, technical support, and client relations, and is tightly integrated into DAIâ€™s global organization, tapping the full range of technical specialists and support staff from our U.S. and U.K. operations.

The team designs and implements a wide range of development solutions for European Union (EU) institutions in priority areas such as food security, resilience, private sector development and trade, energy and climate change, governance, and communications and knowledge management.

## Our Projects in EU Partner Countries

DAI Brussels is supporting the implementation of the [EU Budget Support State-building Programme in the Gambia](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/the-gambia-state-building-contract-1-complementary-support-sbc1-cs), with a local team of experts working closely with government stakeholders through advice, coaching, and capacity building. Other projects include the [Technical Assistance to the Zimbabwe Agriculture Growth Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/zimbabwe-technical-assistance-to-the-zimbabwe-agricultural-growth-programme-zagp) that is strengthening local institutions and building capacity across Zimbabwe's livestock sector and the [Ethiopia Technical Assistance to Support GCCA\+/Mainstreaming Climate-Smart Approaches into the Productive Safety Net Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-technical-assistance-to-support-gcca-plus-mainstreaming-of-climate-smart-planning-and-implementation-approaches) supporting the Ministry of Agriculture to mainstream climate-smart initiatives and produce evidence to promote dialogue on climate-sensitive programming and climate financing.

DAI Brussels also provides management support on the [Technical Assistance Programme to Food Security Nutrition and Climate Resilience in the Dry Corridor (EUROSAN)](/our-work/projects/honduras-technical-assistance-food-security-nutrition-and-climate-resilience-dry) Honduras. The project is aiming to improve food and nutritional security of 15,000 rural families through the creation of sustainable agricultural systems, providing advice to safeguard against climate change, supporting nutritional education, and strengthening national and local institutions in the poorest regions of the country.

The [Technical and Advisory Services for Social Transfers for Food Security and Nutrition (ASiST III) Programme](/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-and-advisory-services-social-transfers-asist) also has a strong base in Brussels. Our Brussels Liaison Officer is working closely with DEVCO C1, serving as the coordination bridge to facilitate technical and thematic collaboration with relevant DEVCO Units and supporting knowledge management, communication, and activity coordination. Through this demand-driven service, DAI is helping the European Commission and the EU Delegations to increase the impact, quality, coverage, and sustainability of social transfer schemes that target food and nutrition security, resilience, and sustainable agriculture.

DAI Brussels was officially registered as a separate Belgian legal entity in July 2016. As a global organization, DAI Brussels is a member of Friends of Europe and the European Federation of Management Consultancies Association and a partner of ECDPM.
