# Brussels

DAI has long had a project presence in the European capital and in 2016 we established a formal corporate office, bringing us closer to our clients in the European Commission and elsewhere on the continent. The Brussels team of programme managers and technical staff focuses on business development, project management, technical support, and client relations, and is tightly integrated into DAI’s global organization, tapping the full range of technical specialists and support staff from our U.S. and U.K. operations.

The team designs and implements a wide range of development solutions for European Union (EU) institutions in priority areas such as food security, resilience, private sector development and trade, energy and climate change, governance, and communications and knowledge management.

## Our Projects in EU Partner Countries

DAI Brussels is supporting the implementation of the [EU Budget Support State-building Programme in the Gambia](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/the-gambia-state-building-contract-1-complementary-support-sbc1-cs), with a local team of experts working closely with government stakeholders through advice, coaching, and capacity building. Other projects include the [Technical Assistance to the Zimbabwe Agriculture Growth Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/zimbabwe-technical-assistance-to-the-zimbabwe-agricultural-growth-programme-zagp) that is strengthening local institutions and building capacity across Zimbabwe’s livestock sector and the [Ethiopia Technical Assistance to Support GCCA\+/Mainstreaming Climate-Smart Approaches into the Productive Safety Net Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-technical-assistance-to-support-gcca-plus-mainstreaming-of-climate-smart-planning-and-implementation-approaches) supporting the Ministry of Agriculture to mainstream climate-smart initiatives and produce evidence to promote dialogue on climate-sensitive programming and climate financing.

## Global Facilities at Headquarters Level

The [Technical and Advisory Services for Social Transfers for Food Security and Nutrition (ASiST III) Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-and-advisory-services-social-transfers-asist) and the [Trade, Private Sector Development, and Engagement (TPSD/E) Facility](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-trade-private-sector-development-and-engagement-and-regional-integration-facility) have very strong bases in Brussels. Through these demand-driven services, DAI provides technical expertise, knowledge management, and communications expertise to thematic units in rural development, food security, and nutrition (DEVCO C1) and private sector and trade (DEVCO C4) and to EU Delegations worldwide. 

## Framework Contracts 

DAI has a [long history](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/new-generation-of-ec-framework-contracts-offers-agile-programming-for-european-development-aid/) of supporting the EC’s framework contracts, with the first contract dating back more than 20 years. DAI Brussels is currently leading the COM 2015 lot 1 (Evaluation) and is present on all six lots of the SIEA Framework contracts (2018 to 2022), leading on lots 1 (Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Resilience) and 3 (Human Rights, Democracy and Peace) and partnering with renown consulting firms on the other four lots. 

DAI Brussels was officially registered as a separate Belgian legal entity in July 2016. As a global organization, DAI Brussels is a member of Friends of Europe and the European Federation of Management Consultancies Association and a partner of ECDPM.
