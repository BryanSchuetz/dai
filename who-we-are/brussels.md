# European Union

DAI has long had a presence in continental Europe. With the [acquisition](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-acquires-leading-european-development-consultancy-human-dynamics) of the distinguished European development consultancy [Human Dynamics](https://www.humandynamics.org/) in 2019, we achieved the scale and technical breadth that enables us to offer richer services and better value to our customers in the European Union. We also became the largest single provider of development services to the European Commission. 

From corporate locations in Ankara (Turkey), Belgrade (Serbia), Brussels (Belgium), Cologne (Germany), London (United Kingdom), Sofia (Bulgaria), and Vienna (Austria), our team of 100+ employees oversees a portfolio of more than 50 EU projects in 75 countries.

Our EU Business Unit covers the whole spectrum of DAI operations, from project delivery, framework contract implementation, and global facilities management to business development, communications, and knowledge management. The EU team is seamlessly integrated into DAIâ€™s global organization, tapping the full range of technical specialists and support staff from our U.S., U.K., and other business units. 

This team orchestrates a network of some 800 in-house and external experts currently engaged on short- and long-terms assignments encompassing all EU technical areas, including sustainable economic growth and agriculture, resilience, gender, infrastructure, digitalisation, global health, governance and public administration, social protection, education, climate change, and green energy. 

DAI has extensive experience working with DG DEVCO and NEAR, EEAS, and European development finance institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. 

We partner with these and other clients to support the [European Consensus on Development](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/european-consensus-development_en) and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As a signatory of the UN Global Compact, we report on our contributions to achieving the SDGs in our annual [Communication on Progress](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-makes-its-2019-communication-on-progress-to-the-un-global-compact). As an [employee-owned](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/employee-owners) and [mission-oriented](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/mission-and-values) enterprise, we are wholly committed to upholding the highest standard of responsible and sustainable business.
