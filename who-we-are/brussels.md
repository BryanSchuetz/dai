# Brussels

DAI has long had a project presence in the European capital and in 2016 we established a formal corporate office, bringing us closer to our clients in the European Commission and elsewhere on the continent. The Brussels team of programme managers and technical staff focuses on business development, project management, and client relations, and is tightly integrated into DAIâ€™s global organization, tapping the full range of technical specialists and support staff from our U.S. and U.K. operations.

Currently, the Brussels office oversees numerous projects, ranging from EC training and technical assistance to demand-driven advisory services. Since January 2017, DAI Brussels has been managing an EU-funded [Trade, Private Sector Development and Engagement, and Regional Integration Facility (TPSD)](/our-work/projects/worldwide-trade-private-sector-development-and-engagement-and-regional-integration-facility). Through this programme, our Brussels-based team provides policy advice, knowledge management, and communications expertise to DEVCO C4.

DAI Brussels also provides management support on the [Technical Assistance Programme to Food Security Nutrition and Climate Resilience in the Dry Corridor (EUROSAN)](/our-work/projects/honduras-technical-assistance-food-security-nutrition-and-climate-resilience-dry) Honduras. The project is aiming to improve food and nutritional security of 15,000 rural families through the creation of sustainable agricultural systems, providing advice to safeguard against climate change, supporting nutritional education, and strengthening national and local institutions in the poorest regions of the country.

The [Technical and Advisory Services for Social Transfers for Food Security and Nutrition (ASiST III) Programme](/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-and-advisory-services-social-transfers-asist) also has a strong base in Brussels. Our Brussels Liaison Officer is working closely with DEVCO C1, serving as the coordination bridge to facilitate technical and thematic collaboration with relevant DEVCO Units and supporting knowledge management, communication, and activity coordination. Through this demand-driven service, DAI is helping the European Commission and the EU Delegations to increase the impact, quality, coverage, and sustainability of social transfer schemes that target food and nutrition security, resilience, and sustainable agriculture.

The Brussels office will be a key venue for engaging with the European and wider development community. As a global organization, DAI Brussels is a member of Friends of Europe and the European Federation of Management Consultancies Associations.

DAI Brussels was officially registered as a separate Belgian legal entity in July 2016.
