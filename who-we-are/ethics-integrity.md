Ethics, integrity, and compliance are fundamental DAI values at the core of how DAI interacts with clients, partners, employees, and vendors across the globe. These values are embodied in DAI’s Global Ethics and Compliance Program, which is affirmed by DAI’s Board of Directors, and applied across the entire company and all entities in which DAI has an ownership position.

DAI’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees the Ethics and Compliance program, promotes a culture of compliance through training and regular communication on important topics, and works with DAI management to establish, monitor, and enforce standards, policies, and procedures to identify and prevent illegal, unethical, or improper conduct.

At DAI, we take compliance seriously. Accomplishing development results in challenging circumstances while complying with funding partner and host nation laws and policies requires disciplined performance. DAI professionals recognize that meeting these high standards will model effective and compliant management to their beneficiaries and establish trusting relationships essential to successful development.
