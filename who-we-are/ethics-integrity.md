Ethics, integrity, and compliance are fundamental DAI values at the core of how DAI interacts with clients, partners, employees, and vendors across the globe. These values are embodied in DAI’s Global Ethics and Compliance Program, which is affirmed by DAI’s Board of Directors, and applied across the entire company and all entities in which DAI has an ownership position.

DAI’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees the Ethics and Compliance program, promotes a culture of compliance through training and regular communication on important topics, and works with DAI management to establish, monitor, and enforce standards, policies, and procedures to identify and prevent illegal, unethical, or improper conduct.
