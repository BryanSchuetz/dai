In line with [our values](/who-we-are/mission-and-values), DAI is committed to fostering diversity, equity, engagement, and inclusion inside DAI, in our work around the world, and within the international development sector. You’ll notice that we add an extra “E” to the familiar DEI acronym, which stands for engagement—underscoring how important it is for us to have every member of staff energetically involved as part of our shared corporate purpose.

## Our DEEI Plan

We weave diversity, equity, engagement, and inclusion into every aspect of our business and across every region and country where we operate, working across three pillars: people, solutions, and partnerships.

          We work alongside underserved groups and communities to help them address the issues and inequities they face. From providing LGBTQI+ healthcare services in Colombia to expanding gender inclusion in Nepal and women's empowerment in the Middle East, we put DEEI and inclusive development at the heart of the work we do.

        <h3>Partnerships</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          We are more effective in addressing racism, discrimination, and exclusion when we build bridges with like-minded organizations. DAI is a founding member of the Coalition for Racial & Ethnic Equity in Development (CREED) and a lead member of the WILD Network (Women in Global Development Leadership Forum). Global Head of DEEI Bobby Jefferson is a member of the Society for International Development–U.S. Executive Committee. In that role, he instituted the Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity workgroup and set their DEI strategic plan in motion. He is also co-chair of the Council of International Development Companies’ DEI Committee and participates in British Expertise International’s Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Working Group. Our goal is to advance DEEI within the development sector and beyond.
