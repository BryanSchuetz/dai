<p>Lorem. The boy stood on the burning deck
Whence all but he had fled;
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
Shone round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm;
A creature of heroic blood,
A proud, though child-like form. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Lorem. The flames rolled on–he would not go
Without his Father's word;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Lorem. He called aloud–'say, Father, say
If yet my task is done?'
He knew not that the chieftain lay
Unconscious of his son. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Lorem. 'Speak, father!' once again he cried,
'If I may yet be gone!'
And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on. Ipsum.
