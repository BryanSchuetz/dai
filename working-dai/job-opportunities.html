<p>It is the policy of DAI to use the Internet and related electronic data technologies to fill all vacant home office (corporate) positions. Job seekers, both internal and external, including but not limited to individuals sourced by means of job fairs, networking events, and employee referrals, will be directed to apply at the DAI online career page.
