# Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund

For the second time, DAI has been awarded a place on the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund (CSSF) Framework by the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). This Framework runs through December 2020 with a possibility to extend by a further two years.

<aside>As a framework holder, DAI will provide the UK Government with timely access to high-quality, cost-effective, and professional technical consultancy services. If you are interested in joining DAI’s CSSF Framework network, please contact Kieran Griffin at <a href="mailto:kieran_griffin@dai.com">kieran_griffin@dai.com</a>.</aside>

The CSSF was created to tackle fragility in conflict affected countries at the direction of the National Security Council (NSC). In 2016–2017, it delivered against two of the National Security Objectives outlined in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (2015). The CSSF also delivers against the UK Aid Strategy (where it contributes to three of four objectives for aid), and funds activity which complements core departmental work.

Combining multiyear activity with short-term interventions and access to crisis reserves, the CSSF has ensured the UK Government can move quickly to deliver on unanticipated interventions. The CSSF blends Official Development Assistance with other funding sources in one instrument. 

The framework provides access to effective and cost-efficient services to help deliver UK Government objectives contained within the NSC strategies and to support UK Government’s work responding to crises, instability, and insecurity in fragile and conflict-affected states in an integrated manner.

The framework covers a broad range of thematic areas, including: 
* Understanding and strengthening inclusive politics, political processes, and accountability.
* Public sector reform and public financial management.
* Security sector reform and security sector capacity building.
* Justice sector reform and rule of law.
* Counter violence extremism/counter terrorism.
* Peace-building, stabilisation, and conflict sensitivity.
* State/civil society engagement.
* Inclusive conflict prevention and peacebuilding.
* Strategic communication and outreach.
* Defence training and advice.
* Provision of nonlethal equipment.
* Defence services.
