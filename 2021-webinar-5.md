According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an additional 47 million women and girls will be pushed into extreme poverty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, the pandemic disproportionately affects women and girls in developing countries, with higher infection rates, loss of livelihood opportunities, and overindebtedness. Mainstreaming gender smart investment is one of the responses of the development community to mobilise public and private funding and provide women with improved access to leadership opportunities, quality employment, finance, enterprise support and products and services that enhance economic participation and access. This panel will discuss innovative and practical approaches and policies to support the mainstreaming of gender smart investing.
