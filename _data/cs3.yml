  summary: "As measures to counter violent extremism (CVE) are complex and unproven, development practitioners must pay attention to any and all variables that even appear to be important. One of those key common factors is the importance of a good facilitator. Luckily, the field of public health has much to teach us on this topic."

  summary: "Is it possible to build a fragility index that is truly useful as a tool for day-to-day development programming on the ground? That’s what we’re trying in Nigeria."

  summary: "It is broadly understood that language—especially generalizing and dehumanizing language—can play a central role in fostering communal violence. William Donohue has shown how the language of classification was a key early warning in the Rwandan genocide, for example. Such instances should remind the development community to be mindful of the words they use, however innocuous they may seem. Case in point: a term often used in discussion of economics and conflict in the African Sahel, “pastoralist.”"

  summary: "A review of “Conflict, Violent Extremism and Development: New Challenges, New Responses”

One of the most acute challenges of working in conflict zones is differentiating between “legitimate” conflict actors and extremist groups. In countries such as Libya and Syria, state collapse has led to a proliferation of armed groups and institutions—all claiming legitimacy and exerting authority over populations. Among these are groups that most observers consider “extreme” in that they are internationally recognized as terrorist groups or they use terrorist tactics to coerce populations."

  summary: "Recent research by DAI’s Enhancing Governance, Accountability, and Engagement (ENGAGE) project team in Mindanao demonstrates that while membership in violent extremist groups is overwhelmingly male, there is limited evidence to suggest that support for violent extremist ideologies differs fundamentally between the sexes."

  summary: "So-called fake news is an issue du jour in Washington and beyond. While it has undoubtedly been hyped for political reasons, fake news is real, its dangers clear and present—especially in unstable environments.

Even in the United States, the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and subsequent Comet Ping Pong shooting in Washington, D.C., in December 2016 shows how quickly fake news can turn to real violence. Internationally, journalist Stephanie Busari has shown how fake news allows us to be passive in dismissing real atrocities as “hoaxes,” highlighting how Nigerian authorities’ use of the label “fake news” led to loss of life and increased suffering for the Chibok girls of northern Nigeria at the hands of Boko Haram."

  summary: "Since the Bamako Agreement of 2015, the international security and development community has invested in significant stabilization programs for Northern Mali, and specifically the Timbuktu, Gao, and Kidal regions. Northern Mali and its roughly 1.3 million people are more engaged and resilient as a result, but now “the center” of the country—home to 4.5 million Malians—appears to be rapidly destabilizing."

  summary: "Anyone who has worked in transition or stabilization environments knows the value of good research. But good research tends to have two drawbacks that constrain its applicability for professionals working in unstable environments: it takes time and it’s expensive. Even the best research, if it comes too late, is of little use if you’re working in fast-moving situations. And good research is too often priced out of reach for small and medium projects, particularly research conducted in places experiencing conflict and instability."

  summary: "The social critic and author Christopher Hitchens wrote: “What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.”

Research, applied learning, and fierce debates about measuring success and failure, about embracing new ideas and technologies, and about adapting concepts and practices from both the development and national defense disciplines are the foundation on which we have built DAI’s Center for Secure and Stable States. Our goal is to “move the needle” on the complex problem sets of violent extremism and insurgency, political and security transitions, and community stabilization and cohesion. The purpose of this blog is to create a community of practitioners with whom we can have these animated—and at times difficult—conversations about how to broaden the evidence base to both achieve development impact and support U.S. national security interests around these problem sets."
