Only ﬁve in ten rural births are attended to by a skilled provider, compared to almost nine in ten urban births – a striking rural-urban divide. The More Mobilising Access to Maternal Health Services in Zambia programme (MORE MAMaZ) programme worked with the Zambian government to scale up a community-based intervention that addressed MNH barriers and delays originating at household and community levels. The programme strengthened and broadened the focus of the national Safe Motherhood Action Group (SMAG) initiative, a key part of the government’s safe motherhood policy response. An empowerment approach mobilised communities around a MNH agenda and built local capacity to take action. The results from MORE MAMaZ provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of the approach.",

Key stakeholders are now beginning to understand some of the gender issues that have affected other emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola and avian flu. It is logical to expect that whatever pandemic will arise next will have a gendered component, so all countries should be prepared to address gender as a key issue for multisectoral coordination and collaboration, as well as policies and programs. Gender considerations can be directly incorporated into preparedness and response planning but can also be part of a government’s existing framework to address gender inequality and women’s empowerment and in various sectoral strategies for human health, water management, markets, agriculture, and animal care.",
