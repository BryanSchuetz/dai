The More Mobilising Access to Maternal Health Services in Zambia programme (MORE MAMaZ) programme worked with the Zambian government to scale up a community-based intervention that addressed MNH barriers and delays originating at household and community levels. The programme strengthened and broadened the focus of the national Safe Motherhood Action Group (SMAG) initiative, a key part of the government’s safe motherhood policy response. An empowerment approach mobilised communities around a MNH agenda and built local capacity to take action. The results from MORE MAMaZ provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of the approach.",

Key stakeholders are now beginning to understand some of the gender issues that have affected other emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola and avian flu. It is logical to expect that whatever pandemic will arise next will have a gendered component, so all countries should be prepared to address gender as a key issue for multisectoral coordination and collaboration, as well as policies and programs. Gender considerations can be directly incorporated into preparedness and response planning but can also be part of a government’s existing framework to address gender inequality and women’s empowerment and in various sectoral strategies for human health, water management, markets, agriculture, and animal care.",

ZIFAS began as a collaboration between the Micronutrient Initiative and the Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunisation in Northern Nigeria/Maternal Newborn Child Health (PRRINN/MNCH). ZIFAS built on the platform of PRRINN/MNCH, supporting efforts in women’s empowerment, governance and health system strengthening and working in the same states, to develop and implement integrated strategies to improve quality and use of Zinc, low-osmolality oral rehydration salts (Lo-ORS) for diarrhoea in children and low dose and iron and folic acid supplements for pregnant women. An innovative policy framework coupled with demand and supply side interventions was introduced to scale up coverage and use of Zinc/Lo-ORS and IFAS. As well as managing the ZIFAS programme, HPI also enhanced the enabling environment for nutrition action through improving service delivery systems, governance and community engagement in health and financing. By adopting a health system strengthening approach and building on initiatives implemented by PRRINN/MNCH, ZIFAS was able to promote the long-term sustainable supply of essential commodities in the public health system. ZIFAS used an innovative integrated extensive community-engagement approach which facilitated a significant scale up of nutrition interventions.",

Cultural, physical, and financial barriers prevent many families from accessing health care. The Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria; Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Initiative (PRRINN-MNCH) was a project funded by the UK Department of International Development and the Norwegian government that used an integrated approach to strengthen health services and increase community demand for and access to quality health care. The project’s community engagement approach aimed to empower communities, work with volunteers, and develop solutions to overcome barriers to health. Simultaneously, PRRINN-MNCH was building primary health care systems, including immunization, and strengthening governance to increase the availability and quality of services. Baseline and endline population-based random household surveys conducted in 2009 and 2013 showed improved community knowledge, increased use of antenatal care and immunization services, and a decrease in maternal, infant, and under-5 mortality.",

      "docSummary": "The experience of a donor-supported Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (RMNCH) program in four states of Northern Nigeria illustrates how a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) approach to health system strengthening can lead to health systems becoming more resilient. The programme worked with the array of political, cultural and social determinants which interact to shape the health system and its functionality. It worked in an environment marked by weak governance with little public accountability and by very limited management capability in inadequately regulated markets. To these conditions of fragility was added the shock from the rapidly deteriorating security situation caused from 2011 by the Boko Haram insurgency and the government’s ensuing response. A CAS theory of change provided the basis for the multi-faceted approach that identified critical points of leverage among institutions in social as well as professional systems and helped achieve significant improvements in health service delivery in the RMNCH continuum of care. It also established the foundation for Primary Health Care Under One Roof (PHCUOR), which has emerged as a central national strategy in Nigeria for strengthening health sector governance and services under the 2014 Health Act.",

      "docSummary": "This study examines how Nigeria’s Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Program on Maternal and Child Health (SURE-P MCH) Village Health Worker (VHW) programme provides a model for the Nigerian Road Map for VHWs. Community Health Workers (CHWs) can facilitate access to primary health care services among isolated rural communities. The study used pre-post with comparison model design, comparing two successive VHW cohorts recruited in 2013  and in 2014 in Jigawa, Katsina and Zamfara states. The study collected performance statistics and conducted interviews with the VHWs, and focus group discussions with the VHWs, their CHEW mentors, the in-charges at the facilities, and the village health/ward development committees overseeing the recruitment and support of the VHWs. Significant differences between the 2013 and 2014 cohort were assessed using bi-variate statistics. All VHWs were female. VHWs worked 20.8 hours/week, and averaged 34.3 home visits/month. Results show that after their training, 90% were comfortable with their primary tasks of encouraging antenatal care (ANC) visits and teaching about a healthy pregnancy.",

      "docSummary": "The experience of a donor-supported Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (RMNCH) program in four states of Northern Nigeria illustrates how a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) approach to health system strengthening can lead to health systems becoming more resilient. The programme worked with the array of political, cultural and social determinants which interact to shape the health system and its functionality. It worked in an environment marked by weak governance with little public accountability and by very limited management capability in inadequately regulated markets. To these conditions of fragility was added the shock from the rapidly deteriorating security situation caused from 2011 by the Boko Haram insurgency and the government’s ensuing response. A CAS theory of change provided the basis for the multi-faceted approach that identified critical points of leverage among institutions in social as well as professional systems and helped achieve significant improvements in health service delivery in the RMNCH continuum of care. It also established the foundation for Primary Health Care Under One Roof (PHCUOR), which has emerged as a central national strategy in Nigeria for strengthening health sector governance and services under the 2014 Health Act.",

Overall, in RBF versus IBF, a child was: Three times more likely to be treated correctly for malaria Over six times more likely to be treated correctly for pneumonia Over eight times more likely to be treated correctly for diarrhoea The main effect in terms of quality of care was differentiated by level of institution. The strongest improvements were observed in lower level facilities. Indicators related to both utilisation and supply of essential medicines similarly showed the most improvement in the lower level facilities in the RBF arm relative to the IBF arm. ",

      "docSummary": "The perceived benefits of a One Health approach are largely hinged on increasing public health efficiency and cost effectiveness through a better understanding of disease risk–through shared control and detection efforts, and results that benefit human, animal and ecosystem health. However, there have been few efforts to identify and systematize One Health metrics to assess these perceived efficiencies. Though emphasis on the evaluation of One Health has increased, widely cited benefits of One Health approaches have mainly been based on modeled projections, rather than outcomes of implemented interventions. We conducted a review of One Health literature to determine the current status of One Health frameworks and case studies reporting One Health metrics. Of 1839 unique papers, only 7 reported quantitative outcomes; these assessments did not follow shared methodology and several reviewed only intermediate outcomes. For others, the effectiveness of One Health approaches was often assumed without supporting evidence or determined subjectively. The absence of a standardized frame- work to capture metrics across disciplines, even in a generic format, may hinder the more widespread adoption of One Health among stakeholders. We review possible outcome metrics suitable for the future evaluation of One Health, noting the relevance of cost outcomes to the three main disciplines associated with One Health.",

The construction of the International Health Regulations (2005) guidelines and the WHO health systems framework, has resulted in the separation of public health functions and health-care services, which are interdependent in actuality and must be integrated to ensure a continuous, unbroken national health system. By analysing efforts to strengthen health systems towards attaining universal health coverage and investments to improve global health security, we examine areas of overlap and offer recommendations for construction of a unified national health system that includes public health. One way towards achieving universal health coverage is to broaden the definition of a health system.",

While MOHs are responsible for defining the overall direction of national health policy and the day-to-day delivery of public health services, they are dependent upon MOFs that establish overall annual funding levels and release funds necessary to finance MOH operations. As a result, MOFs wield significant control over the funding and budget flexibility of MOHs. The HFG toolkit presents a set of strategies, self-assessment methodologies, and performance management processes to help MOHs better manage their own resources and effectively communicate with MOFs. The initial version of the HFG toolkit focuses specifically on the MOH / MOF dynamic. Over time it will expand to address collaboration between MOHs and a broader set of stakeholders in the health system, including Ministries of Planning, Ministries of Social Welfare, Ministries of Labor, Parliamentary Standing Committees on Health, civil society organizations, parastatals, and regulatory bodies.",

      "docTitle": "Developing Key Performance Indicators",
      "docSummary": "Over the last several decades, governments worldwide have introduced budgetary and reporting mechanisms designed to demystify government operations and illuminate how public funds are being used to achieve policy goals. Whether dubbed “program” budgeting, “performance” budgeting, or “results-based” budgeting, the trend has seen a conceptual shift from an approach that was heavily oriented to inputs, to models designed to provide government decision makers, parliaments, and citizens with a clearer picture of what governments achieve for the public funds they spend. Performance measurement, and the use of key performance indicators (KPIs), is an integral part of any of these models, providing feedback to inform and improve public service delivery and promoting accountability by demonstrating to key stakeholders the results that government is achieving. Few economic sectors depend on performance information as intensively as does public health, where safety, speed, access, and cost can literally be “life or death” matters. With growing demands to improve health care quality, coverage, and outcomes, health sector decision makers not only face the challenge of allocating resources to the highest priorities, but also of ensuring that those resources are put to good use, deliver “value for money,” and achieve the intended outcomes or impact. KPIs are central to this agenda. Moreover, because of their importance to both budget management and accountability, KPIs also represent a key point of convergence between ministries of health (MOHs) and ministries of finance (MOFs) or, where separate from the MOF, the central budget authority.",

      "docSummary": "The health sector accounts for a sizeable proportion of national expenditures in most countries. The pursuit of efficiency in health systems should, therefore, be a central objective of decision makers and health managers. Often, Ministries of Health do not have access to the data to properly assess internal efficiency across their operations—including physician utilization, deployment of health technologies and pharmaceuticals, and use of health facilities and hospital care. Measuring efficiency across institutions and across time is a critical element for improving the performance of health systems. The data for efficiency tool outlines key data categories and indicators necessary for assessing efficiency in the use of resource inputs, provides guidance on sources for these data, and calculation of indicators. Applying this tool, managers within Ministries of Health will be better prepared to defend their budget requests—providing evidence of internal efficiency—while ensuring effective and efficient spending of monies that are allocated.",

      "docSummary": "Governments and international donor organizations increasingly acknowledge the role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in strengthening health systems. By facilitatingdialogue between government and citizens on issues of health sector priorities, performance, and accountability, CSOs can help to improve health service delivery and contribute to evidence-based policy. Often, however, CSOs lack the skills and tools needed to engage other stakeholdersin issues of health finance and governance. This guide provides practical advice on the range of tools available to CSOs in the health sector, with a specific focus on social accountability tools to help gain access to information, mobilize collective action and advocacy, and support sanctions. The guide also describes how effective civil society engagement, including efforts using social accountability tools, has resulted in important reforms to improve health service delivery performance and inform evidence-based policy. Designing programs that include the use of mechanisms and tools to engage both civil society and government counterparts that are guided by an understanding of the country context, and that recognize and mitigate potential risks are significant factors in productive civil society engagement. Intended for both governments and donors, this guide details several specific and tested practices to promote effective use of these tools.",

While these organizations may have important contributions to make, they often are not aware of the most effective and accessible entry points to use. Entry Point Mapping provides a methodology for systemic review and identification of mechanisms, forums and public platforms by which civil society organizations can participate in health sector policy formulation, program implementation, and oversight. This paper presents an Entry Point Mapping Tool designed for CSOs with advocacy experience and public health officials seeking to expand civil society participation and contain a step-by-step guide for researching and analyzing legal entry points for civil society participation in governance of public health care facilities.",

      "docSummary": "Public health responses to priority health for Parliamentarians”1 and the Inter-Parliamentary challenges are complex, technical, and involve numerous institutions, funding sources, and commitments to international strategies. Efforts to end preventable child and maternal deaths, for example, may include initiatives targeting both child and maternal health, malaria, immunizations and nutrition, among others. This guide will use maternal health and child health as themes to illustrate the challenges that face MPs and parliamentary committees while addressing these complex issues, however the approaches described here can be employed in a variety of contexts within the health field as well as other public policy areas. In addition, for the purposes of this guide, it is important to note how efforts to reduce child and maternal mortality differ and converge with the broader effort to improve maternal and child health. While these two are closely related, they are not identical. Improving child and maternal health is an umbrella term that addresses a full range of efforts to help pregnant women and children thrive. Programming to reduce child and maternal mortality seeks to target the key causes of preventable deaths of pregnant women and children under 5 years of age. The approaches and techniques discussed here can apply to variety of situations facing standing health committees as they seek to develop their objectives and action plans.",

There is still considerable debate on which governance interventions are appropriate for different contexts. This lack of evidence can result in avoidance of health governance efforts or an over-reliance on a limited set of governance interventions.

As part of a series on governance interventions that contribute to health system performance, this report aims to increase awareness and understanding of the evidence of what works and why. The report categorizes and reviews evidence from the literature, further informed by several technical experts across a several types of accountability interventions. The extent and strength of evidence varies considerably by category and intervention type. Nevertheless, some clear patterns and findings emerge. A major implication of this evidence review is that accountability interventions matter considerably to health governance. However, the extent and nature of their impacts depend greatly on how interventions are carried out. Numerous studies confirm that increased access to information, social accountability efforts (e.g. citizen scorecards, user committees), increased effective health reporting, pay-for-performance financing, and financial audits, and others are associated with improved accountability and health system performance. This is more often true when multiple techniques are used together and when the overall effort is tailored (through dialogue created by the interventions) to fit the social and institutional context and is sustained over a long enough time period to move from answerability to sanctions.",

      "docSummary": "Many low- and middle-income country (LMIC) governments have made political commitments to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) to provide affordable and quality health services to all, including the poor and vulnerable. To make progress toward UHC, however, LMIC governments need more money for health and to spend it more efficiently. This policy paper explains how public financial management (PFM) mechanisms can be used to help countries achieve the goal of UHC. Health system stakeholders in LMICs should learn how PFM works because PFM mechanisms can be used to help advocate for additional spending. PFM reforms are often in the interest of health system stakeholders, since they help improve efficiency of PFM, advocate for health sector spending priorities, and promote budget transparency. While LMIC governments have increased funding for the health sector over the past decade, more public resources will be required to reach any reasonable definition of UHC. To put the situation into perspective, government spending on health for select low-income countries (LICs) ranged from $2 to $41 per capita in 2015, while total spending on health per capita ranged from $17 to $107, with much of it coming from donor assistance and out-of-pocket payments (WHO 2018). While funding UHC in these countries remains a daunting task, PFM mechanisms can support efforts to increase this funding. This paper seeks to answer questions governments and donors are asking, including: What PFM mechanisms should be used to improve the chances that the health sector benefits and realizes the sustained investments over time necessary to pursue UHC?",

The bitter experience of the Ebola outbreak response served as an important catalyst for increased efforts to comply with World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway capacities, and Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) goals. In November 2016, an interministerial meeting held in Dakar, Senegal, resulted in formalized commitments from the three nations to strengthen resilience to health threats by establishing a Regional Strategic Roadmap to institutionalize the One Health approach. Since then, each country has made significant progress towards establishing National One Health Platforms to coordinate health security interventions, in collaboration with international partners.
