  summary: "Consumer Insights participants in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia.

Last time, in Consumer Insights Indonesia: Mobiles &amp; Workforce Development, I described the Consumer Insights research I recently conducted in Indonesia. To recap: we interviewed 107 Indonesian youth between the ages of 16 and 24, all from marginalized neighborhoods. Our goal was to understand how they receive and share information, what kind of mobile technologies they use, and which messaging and social media apps they prefer. For a full description and more context, please see that post.

This time, it’s straight to the insights."

  summary: "A Consumer Insights survey at Rumah Kitab NGO in East Jakata

Stepping through a narrow alley way, under low-slung balconies and sagging clotheslines, the landscape opens up and what had appeared to be an open field in the middle of a megacity now comes in to view. Prumpung Public Cemetery on a Saturday morning is most certainly the place to be; snack hawkers shout as they amble along the rows of horseshoe shaped headstones, groups of friends congregate alongside tea stands, and families gather around the graves of aunts and uncles. Such was my introduction to the East Jakarta neighborhood of Cipinang Besar Utara, where I would soon be playing Simon Says, dancing, and beatboxing with the 60 Indonesian youth who we interviewed about their media and technology habits."

Decisiones Sobre los Medios Sociales y Mensajería Móvil

Hace poco escribí sobre mi experiencia entrevistando a jóvenes en riesgo en Honduras, sobre sus teléfonos móviles y cómo los utilizan. Si no lo vió, atrápelo aquí: Los móviles en América Central: Consumer Insights Honduras, Parte 1

La mensajería móvil y las redes sociales son muy populares entre los jóvenes de Honduras. Más del 70% de los jóvenes en riesgo en Honduras que hemos entrevistado tenían teléfonos inteligentes, y casi cada uno de los que tenían teléfonos inteligentes utiliza WhatsApp. Facebook es aún más omnipresente. El mensaje es el siguiente: cualquier persona–desde el gobierno de Honduras hasta los donantes como USAID y las organizaciones de la implementación–que quiera trabajar con los jóvenes Hondureños deben buscarlos en sus plataformas nativas de comunicación. En estos días eso significa en las aplicaciones de medios sociales y mensajería."

Chamelecón

Para el observador casual, Chamelecón se parece a cualquier barrio marginal de América Central: tiendas pintadas de color pastel flanquean su calle principal, canalizando un flujo incesante de peatones, carros, y motocicletas. Pero detrás de esta fachada cotidiana, los residentes de Chamelecón se enfrentan a algunos grandes retos: pobreza, desempleo, migración, desintegración familiar, infiltración de pandillas, la violencia y la impunidad. Mientras esta combinación de factores de riesgo es común en los barrios marginales en América Central, en las comunidades de la periferia de San Pedro Sula como Chamelecón, coinciden con fuerza. Cada factor alimenta los demás y aumenta los riesgos que los residentes enfrentan a diario."

  summary: "How do you get city kids interested in agriculture? It’s one of the first questions I was asked when I joined DAI, and as a confirmed urbanite, I must admit it’s not a discussion I expected to have. The topic came up in a meeting with my colleagues in DAI’s Energy &amp; Resources Group, who have been working over the last year with the Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) in Accra, Ghana. The KIC, the flagship corporate social investment effort by Kosmos Energy, is exploring creative ways to address development challenges in Ghana, and in its first year, it has set its sights on boosting Ghana’s agricultural sector."

1) A Direct Line to Your Liver

Bioelectronics is a field poised to change medicine. How do they work? Well, all you have to do is print a nano-scale electronic circuit onto a polymer material that is human-tissue-like enough that your body won’t trigger its natural defense mechanism of rejecting all foreign objects. Then you have to take the neuro-signal patterns from the brain and program the circuits to mimic those neuro-signals. Then, adhere the polymer directly to the malfunctioning tissue and it will deliver brain-like signals straight to the organ. That silly broken liver won’t know the difference!"

Social Media and Messaging Choices

Recently I wrote about my experience interviewing at-risk youth* in Honduras about their mobile phones and how they use them. If you missed that blog, catch it here: Mobiles in Central America: Consumer Insights Honduras, Part 1

Mobile messaging and social media are incredibly popular among Honduran youth. More than 70 percent of the at-risk young people in Honduras who we interviewed had smartphones, and almost every single one who had a smartphone uses WhatsApp. Facebook is even more ubiquitous. The message is this: anyone—from the Honduran government to development actors like USAID and implementing organizations—who wants to engage with Honduran young people must meet them on their native platforms of communication. These days that means social media and messaging apps."

  summary: "Colombia’s 2015 floods affected some 18,000 people. They destroyed homes and bridges, caused the suspension of water and sanitation services, and killed at least 83 people. The loss of life and millions of dollars in damage have re-emphasized the importance of confronting the effects of climate change in Colombia.

DAI is working with the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, its on-campus technology and innovation hub, Centro Ático, and the
Centro Internacional de Agriculture Tropical (CIAT) in Cali to harness the entrepreneurial power of young Colombians to tackle climate change with the aid of NASA satellite data, mobile phones, and their own ingenuity."

To the casual observer, Chamelecón looks like any other marginalized Central American neighborhood: low-slung, pastel-colored shops line its main road, channeling a ceaseless flow of pedestrians, produce carts, motorcycles, and cars. Yet behind this mundane facade, the residents of Chamalecón face some significant challenges: poverty, unemployment, migration, family disintegration, gang infiltration, violence, and impunity. While this combination of risk factors is common in at-risk* neighborhoods around Central America, in communities on the periphery of San Pedro Sula such as Chamalecón, they coincide with acute force—each factor feeding off the rest and exacerbating the daily risks that residents face."

We attended this year’s South by Southwest (SXSW) wanting to know: what new technology will impact the international development sector, and how can we leverage those trends in our work.

Their work—and their livelihood—is based in the field. But things are changing. As with many other sectors, the proliferation of technology means that these professionals increasingly encounter, and are forced to work with, technology on a daily basis. In fact, ignoring new communication technologies represents a missed opportunity for both politicians and citizen groups to effectively engage in the process of political reform."

The digital divide is a buzz phrase that is easy to cite (especially around International Women’s Day!), but considerably harder to address with tangible plans. Quotas? Women-focused events? Round phones? As development practitioners look for the easy answers, we here at Development Innovations Cambodia are pushing back: there isn’t one. Rather than one-off events, we focus on the quality of programming, improving access to digital education, tools and skills, and showing young Cambodians that jobs and careers in tech are viable options for every interested Cambodian, not just young men."
