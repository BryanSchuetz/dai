The Democratic Governance Support Programme, or DIÁLOGO—Diálogo Local para a Boa Governação in Portuguese, is working to contribute to improved governance and accountability for Mozambican citizens in urban municipalities, so that citizens—particularly women and youth—know more, engage more, and vote with confidence in their cities. DIÁLOGO works at the municipal level in the cities of Beira, Maputo, Quelimane, Nampula, and Tete to bring community, media, and political, legislative, executive, and civil society actors together to solve their most immediate governance challenges. DIÁLOGO is engaging with national policymakers, municipal assemblies, and local governments to improve accountability and responsiveness, while aiming to create realistic demand for local governance and greater engagement in the democratic process. DIÁLOGO also aims to link communities and their priorities into constructive national policy debates, policy analysis and research, and investigative journalism. We are implementing DIÁLOGO in association with partners such as Cowi A/S, the Institute of Development Studies, the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa, IREX, and the Civil Society Learning and Capacity Building Centre in Mozambique.
