DAI is incubating HDC+, a regional advocacy and technical assistance hub that contributes to increasing African Government’s commitment, funding, and accountability to HCD

We are incubating Africa HCD+ from a program sponsored within DAI into a fully registered and functional not-for-profit HCD hub in Nigeria to serve as a continental platform, TA hub, and a critical partner for governments. We are working collaboratively with the Africa HCD+ Principal and providing technical assistance in setting up Africa HCD+ to be an independent entity professionally staffed with tested processes, controls, and governance structures established to deliver on its vision.

The Hub will have the capability to serve as an African voice for advocacy, accountability, and transparency on HCD. It will seek to accelerate political commitments, decision-making and funding for key priorities towards realizing Sustainable Development Goals #1-6 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The initial phase will focus on four countries – Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya and Burkina Faso

## Sample Activities

* Collate and review relevant documentation to map out the different approaches and distill a single set of policies, procedures, and guidelines.
* Finalize specifications of the Hub’s organizational structure, its core mandate, and core responsibilities; link organizational functionality to the systems development needed to sustain the Hub’s performance over time. 
* Develop a communication and engagement strategy to increase state-donor collaboration on technical assistance services, from design to deployment, to generate state and donor ownership of the outcome. 
* Monitor technical assistance for work quality, effectiveness, and impact. Conduct random and planned site visits to ensure effective implementation.
