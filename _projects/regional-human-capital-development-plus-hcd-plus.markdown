DAI incubated Human Capital Development Plus (HDC+), a regional advocacy and technical assistance hub that contributes to increasing government commitment, funding, and accountability to developing human capacity across the continent.

We incubated HCD+ from a program sponsored within DAI into a fully registered and functional not-for-profit HCD hub in Nigeria to serve as a continental platform and critical partner for African governments. We provided assistance in setting up HCD+ to be an independent entity professionally staffed with tested processes, controls, and governance structures established to deliver on its vision.

HCD+ has the capability to serve as an African voice for advocacy, accountability, and transparency on issues of human capital. It seeks to accelerate political commitments, decision-making, and funding for key priorities toward realizing Sustainable Development Goals No. 1-6 in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

The initial phase focused on Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.

## Sample Activities

* Collate and review relevant documentation to map out the different approaches and distill a single set of policies, procedures, and guidelines.
* Finalize specifications of the hub’s organizational structure, its core mandate, and core responsibilities; link organizational functionality to the systems development needed to sustain the hub’s performance over time. 
* Develop a communication and engagement strategy to increase state-donor collaboration on technical assistance services, from design to deployment, to generate state and donor ownership of the outcome. 
* Monitor technical assistance for work quality, effectiveness, and impact. Conduct random and planned site visits to ensure effective implementation.

## Select Results

* Facilitated the initial setup of the organization, onboarded the preliminary team, and developed some critical processes and systems essential for the operationalization of the organization. 
* Developed the finance, human resources, and operations, contracts, and consultancy manuals for the Hub to set up the foundational block required for Africa HCD+ operational activities.
