DAI is incubating HDC+, a regional advocacy and technical assistance hub that contributes to increasing government commitment, funding, and accountability to developing human capital across the continent.

We are incubating HCD+ from a program sponsored within DAI into a fully registered and functional not-for-profit HCD hub based in Nigeria to serve as a continental platform and critical partner for African governments. We are providing technical assistance in setting up HCD+ to be an independent entity professionally staffed with tested processes, controls, and governance structures established to deliver on its vision.

HCD+ will have the capability to serve as an African voice for advocacy, accountability, and transparency on issues of human capital. It will seek to accelerate political commitments, decision-making, and funding for key priorities toward realizing Sustainable Development Goals No. 1-6 in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

The initial phase focuses on Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.

## Sample Activities

* Collate and review relevant documentation to map out the different approaches and distill a single set of policies, procedures, and guidelines.
* Finalize specifications of the hub’s organizational structure, its core mandate, and core responsibilities; link organizational functionality to the systems development needed to sustain the hub’s performance over time. 
* Develop a communication and engagement strategy to increase state-donor collaboration on technical assistance services, from design to deployment, to generate state and donor ownership of the outcome. 
* Monitor technical assistance for work quality, effectiveness, and impact. Conduct random and planned site visits to ensure effective implementation.
