By [combining nutrition programming ](https://medium.com/usaid-global-waters/tackling-malnutrition-at-every-turn-ff0961ade674#.ff6g4pdvj)with improved access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), the U.S. Agency for International Development has designed the Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Project (KIWASH). [KIWASH](http://www.kiwash.org/) aims to enable more than 1 million Kenyans across nine counties to gain access to improved WASH services and assist households in gaining access to irrigation and nutrition services.

As county governments take on responsibility for investment in and oversight of service delivery to keep their constituents healthy—and their economies thriving—there is great opportunity to expand service delivery through public-private partnerships that bring new actors into the WASH sector. [KIWASH](https://www.kiwash.org/) will partner with water and sanitation service providers to develop bankable business plans, improve operations, and facilitate access to financing. In parallel, behavior change communication activities linked to Community-Led Total Sanitation and hygiene will stimulate demand for improved household sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition. Our target counties are Busia, Kakamega, Kisumu, Kitui, Makueni, Migori, Nairobi, Nyamira, and Siaya.
