From 2013 to 2014, constitutional reforms and supporting regulations opened Mexico’s oil and gas sector to foreign investment for the first time in nearly 80 years. The reforms and regulations established safeguards to ensure that Mexico would capture socio-economic benefits from its rich hydrocarbon resources.  These safeguards came in the form of minimum national content requirements and were intended to promote local employment and contracting, as well as investment in local capacity development and infrastructure. 

However, before these national content requirements could catalyze economic growth, Mexico needed to overcome a number of obstacles including: lack of readily available national content information; limited multi-stakeholder dialogue; operator reputational risk and liability; and limited supply chain integration.  

In response to these obstacles, the Mexican Association of Hydrocarbon Organiza-tions (AMEXHI), commissioned the DAI Sustainable Business Group (SBG) to con-duct a multi-phase Mexico National Content study consisting of policy analysis and benchmarking, national content methodology simplification, and supply-demand gap analysis. 

Activity 1. Policy Analysis and Benchmarking: DAI first completed a policy analysis of the existing Mexican national content methodology and benchmarked it against other global regulations including those of Canada, Australia, Brazil, Nigeria and Oman. The results of this policy analysis and benchmarking report were then used to design a few national content methodology simplification options, with the intent to facilitate simpler and more accurate data calculation, reporting, and verification.  

Activity 2. National Content Methodology Simplification: DAI subsequently organized a series of workshops with AMEXHI and the Ministry of Economy to present the national content simplification options and gauge both industry and government interest. Following four workshops, a new alternative method that remained compliant with existing law was selected. This simplified methodology included: use of national content percentage coefficients and flowcharts; additional metrics (person-hours); more accurate metric definitions; creation and use of supplier balanced scorecards; design of an iterative methodology streamlining process; and creation of a joint public-private sector national content taskforce1. DAI used its Local Content Plan and Reporting Platform (LCPR) to gather the necessary operator and Tier 1 contractor data and generate the new national content coefficients by supply chain category in order to test the efficacy of the approach. DAI then helped the Ministry develop the proposed language for the amended Directive on calculating National Content and generated a preliminary set of standard co-efficients for key upstream supply chain categories. 

Activity 3: Complementing the above two activities, DAI performed an industrial baseline study of the Mexican upstream oil and gas sector. DAI used its Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM) to quantitively forecast ‘baseline’ and ‘maximum’ amounts of a) economic value and b) full-time equivalent jobs that could be captured by local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the off-shore oil and gas sector.  Through this analysis, we assessed local supply chain competitiveness, identified current supply chain strengths and weaknesses, and proposed key investment opportunities where there was an existing industrial base that could be upgraded to capture more local value.
