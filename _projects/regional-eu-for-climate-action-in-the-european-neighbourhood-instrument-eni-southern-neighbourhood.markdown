Identified as a [climate change hotspot region](https://www.iucn.org/regions/mediterranean/our-work/climate-change-mediterranean), the Southern Mediterranean region is seeing increasing water scarcity, rising temperatures, and growing rates of desertification. The increasing frequency of climate change impacts affects both socio-economic development and the geopolitical environment. The multidimensional nature of climate change calls for a coherent and coordinated multi-sectoral response.
 
DAI is supporting a regional approach to support the transition towards sustainable, low-carbon, and climate-resilient development. The ultimate objective of the [Clima-Med project](https://www.climamed.eu/) is to enhance the energy security and adaptive capacity of the partner countries, leading to more stable, efficient, competitive, and climate-resilient socioeconomic contexts, while increasing energy sovereignty and reducing emissions—in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia.

### Sample Activities 

* Support sustainable climate and energy policies and strategies both at national and local levels.
* Assist in the formulation and implementation of local Sustainable Energy Access and Climate Action Plans in line with the [Global Covenant of Mayors](https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/) principles.
* Identify concrete pilot actions and facilitate climate investments and the setup of finance mechanisms at national and local levels to accomplish those actions.

### Select Results

* Conducted training in three municipalities in Palestine on measurement, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas mitigation, with the support of the Government of Sweden.  
* Helped create a Donors Coordination Group to create synergy with international finance institutions and donors’ initiatives in the Middle East and North Africa, that have the potential to support finance of projects identified in municipal Sustainable Energy Access and Climate Action Plans.
* Approximately 70 municipalities from all seven countries covered by the project, have been supported in preparing their plans. Technical materials (i.e. manuals, e-learning tools, etc.) are being developed by the team. 
* Provided Help Desk Services on a regular basis to local authorities from the Maghreb and Mashreq project offices, to respond to the demand for coaching cities along with the preparation of their climate plans. 
* Engaged more than 20 municipalities in a tree planting awareness campaign.
