Identified as a climate change hotspot region, the Southern Mediterranean region is seeing increasing water scarcity, rising temperatures, and growing rates of desertification. The increasing frequency of climate change impacts affects both socio-economic development and the geopolitical environment. The multidimensional nature of climate change calls for a coherent and coordinated multi-sectoral response.
 
DAI’s Human Dynamics team is supporting a regional approach to support the transition towards sustainable, low-carbon, and climate-resilient development. The ultimate objective is to enhance the energy security and adaptive capacity of the partner countries, leading to more stable, efficient, competitive, and climate-resilient socioeconomic contexts, while increasing energy sovereignty and reducing emissions.

Sample Activities 

•  Support sustainable climate and energy policies and strategies both at national and local levels;
•	Technical assistance for the formulation and implementation of local Sustainable Energy Access and Climate Action Plans (SEACAPs) in line with the Global Covenant of Mayors principles;
•	Identify concrete pilot actions & facilitate climate investments and the setup of finance mechanisms at national and local levels to concretely accomplish those actions;

Select Results

•	Conducted training in three municipalities in Palestine on Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, with the support of SIDA (Government of Sweden).  
•	A Donors Coordination Group (DCG) was created with the support of Contracting Authority to create synergy with IFIs and donors’ initiatives in MENA, that have potential to support finance of projects identified in municipal Sustainable Energy Access and Climate Action Plans (SEACAPs).
•	Approximately 70 municipalities from all seven countries covered by the project, have been supported in preparing their SEACAPs, including templates. Technical materials (i.e. manuals, e-learning tools, etc.) are being developed by the team. 
•	Help Desk Services provided on regular basis to local authorities from the Maghreb and Mashreq project offices, to respond the demand for coaching cities along the preparation of their SEACAPs 
•	Engaged more than 20 municipalities from (MENA) in a Tree Planting awareness campaign, organised with support from the European Union
