The Public Financial Management activity assists the Government of Maldives to prioritize infrastructure projects with the highest returns to the economy, enhance domestic resource mobilization, and realize “win-win” public-private partnerships in infrastructure to reduce dependence on high-risk debt financing.
 
The project supports ministries to adopt performance-based budgeting, engage the private sector and civil society to promote transparency and accountability in public contracting, and integrate gender into public finance reform. 

## Sample Activities

* Strengthen local systems by empowering local champions and cultivating vertical, horizontal, and diagonal networks between the state, private sector, and civil society that mutually reinforce change.
* Increase transparency and bottom-up accountability by incorporating public engagement, including by Atoll Councils, women’s development committees, and private contractor associations.
