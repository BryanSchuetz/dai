The Public Financial Management activity assists the Government of Maldives to prioritize infrastructure projects with the highest returns to the economy, enhance domestic resource mobilization, and realize “win-win” public-private partnerships in infrastructure to reduce dependence on high-risk debt financing.
 
The project supports ministries to adopt performance-based budgeting, engage the private sector and civil society to promote transparency and accountability in public contracting, and integrate gender into public finance reform. 

By the end of the program, Maldives will have the fiscal space and management capacity to effectively and transparently implement President Solih’s Strategic Action Plan (SAP). Public revenues will be steadily increasing, budgets will be better planned and tied to strategic objectives, and public investments will be based on sound analysis and prioritization, resulting in better public services and measurably improved commitment to and capacity for self-reliance.
