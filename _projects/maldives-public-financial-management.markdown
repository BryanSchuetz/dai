The Public Financial Management activity assists the Government of Maldives to prioritize infrastructure projects with the highest returns to the economy, enhance domestic resource mobilization, and realize “win-win” public-private partnerships in infrastructure to reduce dependence on high-risk debt financing.
 
The project supports ministries to adopt performance-based budgeting, engage the private sector and civil society to promote transparency and accountability in public contracting, and integrate gender into public finance reform. 
 
Our team in Maldives includes FJS Consulting, a local audit and advisory firm; Transparency Maldives, a leading civil society organization; and Policy Management Consulting Group, a U.S. small business.
