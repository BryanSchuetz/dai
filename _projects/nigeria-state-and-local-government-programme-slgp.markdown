As part of the Nigeria’s ongoing democratisation, the State and Local Government Programme (SLGP) sought to increase and improvement the interaction between citizens and state governments. SLGP included the strengthening of the civil service and participatory consultation with service providers, including nongovernmental organizations, to determine priority actions for local government and mechanisms of support from central government. 

The programme worked with six authorities (Lagos, Enugu, Jigawa, Kano, Kaduna, and the Federal Capital Territory) and placed a heavy emphasis on process and organisation development and the design and development of demand-driven pilot projects designed to promote best practices. Examples of other inputs provided under this programme are technical and institutional support aimed at improvements in Public Expenditure Management, including budget cycle processes, capacity building, training and sensitisation seminars, and design and installation of financial information systems and computerisation.
