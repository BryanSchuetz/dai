Improving Jordan's productivity will be the key to sustainable economic growth, job creation, increased wages, and improved standards of living. While the private sector is key to stimulating and sustaining growth, it cannot do so alone. The government plays a critical role by creating an environment that fosters private sector excellence. Despite the Government of Jordan's good intentions and various strategic plans for improvement, the Jordanian bureaucracy increases the costs of doing business, which, in turn, discourages private investment. In addition, current regulations and business-government relations are distorting competition and market dynamics, further constraining private sector investment in productive activities. To address these issues, the U.S. Agency for International Development funded SABEQ, which worked with both the public and private sectors to increase the number of jobs available to Jordanians, and enhance the competitiveness of Jordanian firms (ranging from micro through small, medium-sized, and large).

###  Sample Activities

* Increase financial integrity, oversight, and broadened capital markets.
* Expand trade and investment.
* Remove government constraints to achieving private sector competitiveness.
* Enhance productivity (improved people/improved product).
