Montrose International and Health Partners International, a DAI Global Health firm, implemented multiple studies to assess the costs and benefits of Results Based Financing (RBF) relative to Input Based Financing (IBF) in Northern Uganda. The studies aimed to isolate the main effect of the financing modality in terms of quality and quantity of health service provision. 

This project aimed to provide evidence including how cost-effective programme approaches can be adapted to circumstances of fragility, poor governance and weak systems, where unmet need in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health is often greatest.

The resulting “NU Health Policy Brief” was aimed at decision-makers and provided a concise outline of the implications and for policy and programme arising from NU Health.

A second publication, “NU Health Insights Report,” was aimed at programme planners and managers and provided a practical summary of the key learnings from NU Health, with greater detail on context, design and learning.

Finally, a third publication, the “NU Health Technical Annexes,” was aimed at technicians and investigators and complemented the NU Health Policy Brief and NU Health Insights Report to provide additional detail on the approaches, methodologies, and evidence presented in those documents.
