FoodTrade ESA works to systemically improve the national and regional staple food market systems, directly impacting more than 400,000 households and consumers through stable markets for staple food products. The program works to enable private sector to invest and develop regional staple markets, benefiting farmers and consumers.

Based in Dar es Salaam, the program works across nine countries: Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Through two facilitative tools—a Challenge Fund and Development Fund—the program will foster catalytic and innovative solutions.
