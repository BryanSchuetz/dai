FoodTrade ESA works to systemically improve the national and regional staple food market systems, directly impacting more than 400,000 households and consumers through stable markets for staple food products. The program works to enable private sector to invest and develop regional staple markets, benefiting farmers and consumers.

Based in Dar es Salaam, the program will cover nine countries: Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Through two facilitative tools—a Challenge Fund and Development Fund—the program will foster catalytic and innovative solutions. Click [here][1] for more.

###  Sample Activities

* Work with national governments and regional bodies to enact favorable policies that foster regional trade in staples.
* Leverage economic gains facilitated by the program to attract public-private partnership investments to improve infrastructure and transport.
* Create storage mechanisms to enable farmers to better store their food crops and sell when the seasonal prices have risen.
