Under the Feed the Future Senegal Policy Systems Services (PSS) Activity, we collaborate with the U.S. Agency for International Development and Senegalese actors to strengthen the country's agricultural and food policy system.
 
Implemented with Initiative Prospective Agricole et Rurale (IPAR), PSS works to advance Senegal's self-reliance, decrease poverty, improve nutritional outcomes, build resilience, improve water security, and accelerate inclusive agricultural growth and transformation.
