Under the Feed the Future Senegal Policy Systems Services (PSS) Activity, we collaborate with the U.S. Agency for International Development and Senegalese actors to strengthen the country's agricultural and food policy system.
 
Implemented with Initiative Prospective Agricole et Rurale (IPAR), PSS will advance Senegal's self-reliance, decrease poverty, improve nutritional outcomes, build resilience, improve water security, and accelerate inclusive agricultural growth and transformation. 
 
DAI brings to PSS lessons learned from the policy capacity-building and engagement work implemented under the Senegal buy-in to the USAID/Feed the Future: Building Capacity for African Agricultural Transformation (Africa Lead II) program. Indeed, our Chief of Party Aliou Boly—well known and highly regarded in Senegal—led Africa Lead II in Senegal for more than three years and successfully designed and implemented various policy support activities.
