British International Investment (BII)—formerly CDC Group—is the U.K. Government’s development finance institution, supporting the growth of private businesses in Africa and South Asia. 

FSG Plus is a three-year program that will support BII in addressing two pressing priorities—i) inclusion and ii) climate change and environmental sustainability—by catalyzing sustainable practice change in financial institutions. It will do this through:

* Support to BII’s Financial Services Group (FSG) investees.
* Design and delivery of research and events to promote shared learning.

The Facility will promote sustained practice changes in financial services providers leading to improvements in the relevance, quality, affordability, and/or accessibility of financial services for target populations, green sectors, and/or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Through generated evidence and focused assistance, the Facility will help BII investees demonstrate the business case for financial services which would lead to a knock-on effect on other financial service providers (FSPs) in these markets that more visibly support BII’s impact priorities.

### Sample Activities

* Co-creating concept notes with BII’s Financial Services Group and its financial institution investees, designing technical assistance projects.
* Supporting FSPs to develop new financial products according to "best fit"—tailored to the local market context and the needs of the most vulnerable households, smallholder farmers, and SMEs. These products will also promote climate risk management along the pillars of the Task Force on Climate Finance Disclosure, and climate finance and upgrade environmental, social, and governance standards.
* Ensure a diverse and balanced portfolio of technical assistance projects, and use feedback back loops to maximize the synergies between the projects. 
* Leverage research findings to share learnings with the broader FSP market.
* Select, contract, and manage the performance of technical assistance providers.
