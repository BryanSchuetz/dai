The Facility helped to build their capacity and provide a more robust evidence base to pursue vital pro-poor economic and social reforms.

###  Select Results (from PDF1)

**Economic Growth:**

* Transformed YouWiN!, a government-run business-plan grant competition, into a merit-based exercise, with applications rising from 24,000 to 114,000. 
* Supported restructuring of the development finance institution sector and created a “wholesale” approach through the establishment of the Development Bank of Nigeria. With support from the World Bank, the new, more private sector-oriented entity will expand access to funding for Nigerian enterprises and access to formal financial services for smaller borrowers. 
* Assisted in operationalising the Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund. 
* Helped develop national policies for rice, cement, textiles, and trade.
