Over 20 years since its first multi-party elections, the government of Malawi is renewing efforts to decentralize government power, based on the principle that sustainable socioeconomic development is best achieved when decisions are made at the local level. Despite an initially strong legal framework for local governance, institutional tensions as well as confusion over roles and responsibilities between levels of government continues to hinder successful decentralization. District budgets are still allocated by the central government with little local input; political patronage and lack of supervision have led to a cycle of poor performance by public servants; and crucial information is not shared effectively between levels of government. Pervasive constraints such as these contribute to the failure of local governments to deliver basic services to citizens, which serves to undermine government credibility and public faith in the system.

To help ensure that more Malawi citizens benefit from the effects of decentralization, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has designed the Local Government Accountability and Performance (LGAP) activity with these key constraints in mind. LGAP will work across eight target districts to improve local government performance and transparency, increase citizen engagement, and strengthen the enabling environment for decentralization in Malawi.

In working to achieve the vision for LGAP, DAI will take an integrated systems approach that includes providing local government actors with the tools and skills to improve the quality of service, as well as incentivizing collaboration among local government institutions. Initiatives will be district-led, reinforcing ownership and accountability by local stakeholders and improving their capacity to sustain progress.

**Sample Activities**

* Provide targeted capacity-building assistance specific to the roles and requirements of various public servants, with a focus on solving locally relevant problems rather than broad standardized training.

* Identify performance gaps and work closely with embedded teams and local change agents to facilitate institutional reforms and improve organizational effectiveness.

* Improve the government accountability system by strengthening existing mechanisms, such as community scorecards and service management committees, while introducing new accountability tools, including public service charters and social audits.

* Create a dynamic space for collaboration with programs led by USAID and other donors also working in LGAP districts, integrating development activities at the community, district, and national levels.
