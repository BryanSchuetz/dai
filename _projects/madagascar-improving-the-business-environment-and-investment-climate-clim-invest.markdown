Over the past decade, the European Union (EU) has increasingly emphasized the role and importance of the private sector in development and cooperation with Madagascar. 
From this point of view, the support to Madagascar through the CLIM-INVEST project falls explicitly within the framework of EU’s commitments to stimulate investments in the country, the creation of quality jobs, sustainable and inclusive growth, and responsible business conduct.
The project will support the national strategy for improving the business environment and the investment climate and increase the institutional, organizational, and technical capacities of the entities involved in the public-private dialogue. Additionally, the technical assistance will also support efforts to promote the formalization of businesses with a strong social and environmental impact and the monitoring of the reforms necessary to bolster the economic attractiveness of Madagascar. 
Sample activities
•	Consolidate and operationalize the mechanism for public-private dialogue (PPD) in Madagascar
•	Increase institutional capacities for steering the country's competitiveness in terms of the business environment and the investment climate
•	Encourage businesses at the national level to develop their practices in line with internationally established inclusive growth procedures
