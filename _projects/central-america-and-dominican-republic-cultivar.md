Consumers increasingly look for a commitment to social and labor standards from both producers and retailers. Thus, exporters from Central America and the Dominican Republic can improve their competitive position by demonstrating a commitment to such standards. Supported by the U.S. Department of Labor, CULTIVAR aimed to raise labor standard compliance and increase the competitiveness of targeted agricultural sectors in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The four-year, multistakeholder project brought together the main stakeholders in key agricultural sectors to improve working conditions on farms—with an emphasis on health and safety—to raise workers' awareness about their rights, and increase their capacity to use the appropriate mechanisms to exercise them. The project also strengthened the social dialogue on the importance of compliance with national and international labor standards for the region's competitiveness.

###  Sample Activities

* Train rural employers and workers on national labor law, how to document labor conditions, and mechanisms for raising issues and presenting claims at the farm level and with appropriate authorities.
* Work primarily through community-based, multistakeholder committees to develop and implement training.
* Engage socially responsible brands and retailers, as well as international trade unions and nongovernmental organizations, to build support for the project goals.
