The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) is providing funding to strengthen the economies of host and refugee populations in three regions in Ethiopia; Dollo Ado, Gambella, and Jijiga. The Strengthening Host and Refugees Populations in Ethiopia program (SHARPE) works with the private sector to increase economic opportunities and support livelihoods in these regions.

Through the innovative use of an adapted market systems development approach “Markets for Resilience”, SHARPE works to inclusively and sustainably empower refugees and host communities to become more economically resilient.

SHARPE promotes increased refugee self-reliance and generates economic opportunities for host communities through the piloting and scaling of interventions. This approach is based upon understanding the economic barriers that refugee and host communities face, and working with key stakeholders—including businesses, government, and service providers—to make markets work more effectively for SHARPE’s target communities.

SHARPE also serves as a learning platform to the wider international and Ethiopian development community to share lessons in the application of systemic approaches in humanitarian settings. SHARPE expects to benefit up to 100,000 people in the target populations, helping them realize increases in incomes, employment, or expand access to assets through private sector-driven changes.
