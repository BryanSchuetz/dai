SHAHAR is helping create well-governed, fiscally sustainable Afghan municipalities capable of meeting the needs of growing urban populations. Targeted support to municipal governments, as well as to the Deputy Ministry of Municipalities (DMM) and Municipal Advisory Boards, will aim to improve municipal financial management, [urban service delivery](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/afghan-cities-assisted-by-usaid-project-achieve-highest-ratings-in-citizen-survey/), and citizen consultation.

###  Sample Activities

* Assist the DMM in organizing national, regional, and district municipal conferences for sharing best practices and lessons learned.
* Provide technical assistance to each municipality to increase revenue and manage expenses so that they can maintain a healthy, balanced budget. 
* Prepare and implement capacity building plans for municipal officials.

### Select Results

* Twenty SHAHAR-assisted communities [increased revenues by 38 percent](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/afghan-municipalities-raise-more-revenues-deliver-better-services-enhance-stability?utm_source=daidotcom) over the most recent fiscal year, including by 26 percent in the fixed revenues that are key to budget stability.
* Partner municipalities improved their governance scores by an average of 239 percent between July 2015 (baseline) and August 2016 (midline); areas included revenue and finances, planning, service delivery, administrative reform, and community outreach.
* Municipalities successfully bid out and completed 14 projects worth $1.25 million; projects included building bus terminals, renovating parks and sports fields, and improving drainage.
* Operationalized Citizen Service Centers in 10 municipalities, which provide one-stop service for paying taxes and fees, registering properties and businesses, and asking questions.
* Instituted Integrated Financial Management Systems in 13 municipalities.
* Established Municipal Advisory Boards of citizens in 19 of 20 partner municipalities. 
* Piloted a street addressing and [house-numbering project](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/news/street-addressing-saves-business-herat) in district four of the city of Herat, making neighborhoods safer and more professional.
