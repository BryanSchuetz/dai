Jordan’s economy has faced numerous challenges, from waves of refugees to regional instability. The Government of Jordan has been proactive, introducing new tax legislation, improving tax administration, upgrading the budgeting process, and streamlining public expenditures management. However, more work is needed to ensure macro-fiscal resilience while maintaining the fiscal space necessary to deliver social goods to citizens. To support the government in this critical endeavor, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) designed the Public Financial Management and Administration (PFMA) activity. PFMA works to enhance Jordan’s revenue system and improve budget management processes.

PFMA strengthens the capacity of the Jordanian Ministry of Finance (MOF) and other government institutions to modernize revenue collection, encourage compliance, upgrade public procurement management, and improve budget planning, preparation, and execution.

Our work is integrated into local systems and informed by political economy analysis of Jordan’s PFM ecosystem. Central to our approach is change management—structured tools that help government officials transition from the status quo to new ways of operating.

## Sample Activities

* Build capacity within the Studies and Economic Policies Directorate to better utilize their revenue impact model to inform adaptations and fiscal responses to the COVID-19 crisis and deepen economic policy analysis capabilities overall.
* Streamline the budget management process.
* Undertake select tax studies focused on tax base broadening and revenue mobilization impact.
* Develop and implement an electronic revenue management system.
* Strengthen the preparation of results-oriented budgets.
* Strengthen audit processes and procedures. 
* Work with Jordanian Border Control Agencies to develop and implement a coordinated border management plan that will integrate trade requirements with Jordan Customs.

## Select Results

* Developed new, user-friendly tools, including a series of tailored dashboards to visualize budgetary information and data mining tools to assist the search for information. These tools allow stakeholders, depending on their authority, to access the needed information in a timely way. 
* Assisted the Government of Jordan in launching the Government Unit Portal, which makes reporting easier and more efficient for 25 government units. This system improves decision-making and resource allocation by providing a clearer picture of the budgetary situation.
* Assisted the Government Tenders Department to increase utilization of the Jordanian Online E-Procurement System (JONEPS) from 47 to 88 percent, releasing 305 public works and technical services tenders through the system, as well as increasing efficiency, accountability, and transparency.
* Supported the Jordanian Income and Sales Tax Department to implement a national media campaign to promote invoice requesting by taxpayers. The campaign explains how to use the [Fawateery app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jo.istd.fawateery&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) to submit invoices and reached 9.7 million people via press coverage, generating 90,000 downloads.
* Supported the General Budget Department to launch a system that supports results-oriented budgeting and monitors public expenditures against performance, enhancing government activity efficiency and accountability..
* Moved Jordan’s digital debt analysis system from a manual to a digital interface, improving reporting timeliness and accuracy, which enhances Jordan’s credit ratings and helps decrease the country’s cost of borrowing.
