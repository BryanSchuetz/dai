The Public Financial Management and Administration (PFMA) project is a five-year initiative to improve the Jordanian revenue system and enhance the budget management process. 

PFMA will build the capacity of the Jordanian Ministry of Finance and other government institutions to modernize the revenue collection system, encourage compliance—including making it easier for taxpayers to comply with tax obligations—upgrade public procurement management, and improve budget planning, preparation, and execution.
