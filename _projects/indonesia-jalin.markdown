While Indonesia has made significant progress toward key development goals, including greatly reducing child mortality, maternal and newborn deaths in Indonesia occur at higher rates compared with neighboring countries, particularly among poor and vulnerable populations. 

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Jalin project partners with the Indonesian Ministry of Health to reduce maternal and newborn deaths. USAID Jalin uses a whole-of-market approach to improve: 1) maternal and newborn health quality of care in public and private, primary and secondary facilities, and 2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the emergency referral system at community and facility levels. The project works to: sustain improvements in clinical hospital teams’ treatment of obstetric and newborn complications; focus stakeholder strategies on the main causes of maternal and newborn death; sustain improvements to quality of care provided by private midwives; and scale improved referral networks and integrated ICT platforms to support those referrals.  
 
The project supports activities in 120 of the Government of Indonesia’s priority districts for maternal and newborn health nationally and has a presence in 65 of these districts, across six provinces: Banten, Central Java, East Java, North Sumatra, South Sulawesi, and West Java.

### Sample Activities

* Map and group locally-supported solutions and screen for plausibility, scalability, and sustainability, including for delivery through both market and public systems.
* Bring solutions under the Indonesian government’s high-level strategic framework, complementing them with national-level actions to ensure wider learning, broader ownership, national replication or adaptation where feasible for further scaling-up, and potential private sector investment.
* Spotlight potential solutions in the Indonesian government’s strategic intervention areas, including community engagement and empowerment, increased access to antenatal care, improved facility readiness for maternal and newborn healthcare, and strengthened monitoring, evaluation, and accountability mechanisms.

### Select Results (Year One)

* Gathered and synthesized local data on maternal and newborn mortality.
* Disseminated evidence synthesis to major stakeholders—notably the Indonesian government’s transfer of evidence across local, provincial, and national health practitioners and officials.
* Established the Multi-Stakeholder Advisory Body and Provincial Steering Committees to provide advice, support, and guidance to the project’s implementation. 
* Engaged stakeholders in the co-creation process to define problems and develop solutions that have the potential to be scaled and sustained in six provinces and at the national level.
