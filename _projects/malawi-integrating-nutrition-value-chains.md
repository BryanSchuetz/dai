DAI and our partners, Michigan State University and Save the Children, are concentrating on inclusive value chain building in Malawi and smallholders' decision-making about what to plant and consume, acknowledging that smallholders operate under short horizons with limited assets and coping strategies for handling fluctuations in food and income.

The project promotes gender-equitable, agriculture-led, integrated economic growth approaches to increase the competitiveness of the legume and dairy value chains; improve productivity through soil and water management practices; reduce chronic under-nutrition; foster innovation in agricultural value chains; and develop the capacity of local organizations and systems to promote climate change resilience.

The project is also the U.S. Agency for International Development's implementation vehicle to execute Feed the Future and Global Health Initiative strategies. Issues critical to the project's success include gender, information and communication technology, HIV/AIDS, access to financial services, policy advocacy, and climate change.

###  Sample Activities

* Invest in the competitiveness of the legume and dairy value chains where large numbers of smallholders participate—nearly three-quarters of whom are under the poverty line of $1.25 per day.
* Link increased market-oriented production of legumes and dairy to household consumption and improved nutrition.
* Strengthen Malawian agriculture-related organizations so that indigenous institutions, both government and nongovernmental, have the capacity to implement one or more components of this project.
* Support community programs that target behaviorial change in nutrition.
