Volatile food prices, changing weather patterns, and local and regional instability are contributing to increased numbers of refugees, internally displaced people, and food-insecure communities. In a food security crisis, many of these people and communities depend on the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) for assistance. Since 2010, DAI has performed evaluations of WFP's portfolio of programs in Central America, Chad, Haiti, Yemen, Zimbabwe, and Niger to help the organization better implement its food assistance programs.

###  Sample Activities

* Evaluate the entirety of WFP's portfolio in a country over a several-year period.
* Combine quantitative and qualitative tools and methods to make evidence-based recommendations about WFP's strategic alignment in a country, and about strategic partnerships, operational decision making, and program implementation.
* Tailor strategies and recommendations to local country context and challenges.
* Identify ways that WFP can better prepare local communities for natural disasters and other crises.
* Uncover opportunities to better serve internally displaced people.
