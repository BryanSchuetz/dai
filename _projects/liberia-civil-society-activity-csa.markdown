The Liberia Civil Society Activity (CSA) is a five-year initiative to strengthen Liberians’ ability to advocate for policy reforms, policy implementation, and service delivery improvements through multistakeholder coalitions that build feedback loops among the Government of Liberia, civil society organizations, and Liberian citizens.
 
Building on the achievements of the DAI-led [Liberia Accountability and Voice Initiative](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-accountability-and-voice-initiative-lavi), CSA facilitates the formation of issue-based coalitions. Diverse in membership, the coalitions analyze the critical issues most likely to lead to feasible reforms, co-create advocacy strategies, and translate them into improved policy formation and implementation.
 
The coalitions apply citizen engagement strategies and use policy dialogue platforms to integrate citizens’ voices in advocacy agendas, disseminating the results of their advocacy efforts to the broader community to encourage continued dialogue. CSA also ensures that coalition members’ achievements are sustainable by building their financial resilience and adaptive capacities and linking them to a pool of Liberian private sector service providers.
