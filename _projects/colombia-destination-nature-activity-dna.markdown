We are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded USAID/Colombia's Destination Nature Activity (DNA). The innovative new program pushes the boundaries of traditional biodiversity programming, embracing the emerging nature tourism industry as a central pillar for the Government of Colombia to achieve its environmental ambitions, while also meeting its social and economic commitments in the 2016 Peace Accord.
 
DNA will address the root causes of environmental degradation and reduce major drivers of land use change that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions by using nature tourism as a tool for conservation, while supporting the livelihoods of rural citizens, who represent the growing conservation constituency for Colombia’s natural wealth. 
 
Coinciding with the Peace Accords, Colombia's international tourist arrivals surged by 85 percent in the mid-2010s as a new generation of travelers discovered the vibrant flora, remarkable fauna, and unique ecosystems of the world’s second most biodiverse country. DAI's Regenerative Nature Tourism approach embraces this trend and the Colombian government’s commitment to green growth, which is captured in the 2020 Tourism Law.
 
DAI’s Chief of Party—former Vice-Minister of Tourism Julian Guerrero, a lead author of the Tourism Law—will lead a young and energetic all-Colombian team well known in the tourism and biodiversity conservation sectors. DNA will further strengthen DAI’s qualifications in supporting countries to sustainably increase their domestic and international tourism in a post-COVID world.
