Coinciding with the Peace Accords, Colombia's international tourist arrivals surged by 85 percent in the mid-2010s as a new generation of travelers discovered the vibrant flora, remarkable fauna, and unique ecosystems of the world’s second most biodiverse country. DAI's Regenerative Nature Tourism approach embraces this trend and the Colombian government’s commitment to green growth, which is captured in the 2020 Tourism Law.

The Destination Nature Activity (DNA) is an innovative new program pushing the boundaries of traditional biodiversity programming, embracing the emerging nature tourism industry as a central pillar for the Government of Colombia to achieve its environmental ambitions, while also meeting its social and economic commitments in the 2016 Peace Accord.

DNA will further strengthen DAI’s qualifications in supporting countries to sustainably increase their domestic and international tourism in a post-COVID world.
