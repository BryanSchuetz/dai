The National Governance Program (NGP) works with the Government of Georgia to deliver citizen-responsive governance based on greater accountability, transparency, and institutional independence.
 
NGP strengthens accountability systems, procedures, and mechanisms within both governing and independent oversight institutions, and enhances their ability to serve and communicate effectively with the public. This agenda includes strengthening the demand for citizen-responsive governance, supporting localization efforts, and empowering Georgian civil society and the private sector to demand accountability of governance institutions. NGP responds to emerging national and regional priorities such as enhanced public financial management, improved audit functions to thwart major fraud, and anti-corruption capabilities that will advance Georgia’s aspirations for European Union accession. The program also works to bolster cybersecurity in the face of Russian aggression.
