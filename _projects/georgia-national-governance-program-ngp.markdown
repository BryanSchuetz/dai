The Georgia National Governance Program (NGP) works with the Government of Georgia to deliver citizen-responsive governance based on greater accountability, transparency, and institutional independence.
 
Led by DAI’s Richard Haselwood, NGP will strengthen accountability systems, procedures, and mechanisms within both governing and independent oversight institutions, and enhance their ability to serve and communicate effectively with the public. This agenda includes strengthening demand for citizen-responsive governance, supporting localization efforts, and empowering Georgian civil society and the private sector to demand accountability of governance institutions. NGP responds to emerging national and regional priorities such as enhanced public financial management, improved audit functions to thwart major fraud, and anti-corruption capabilities that will advance Georgia’s aspirations for EU accession. The program also dedicates $3 million to bolstering cybersecurity in the face of Russian aggression.
