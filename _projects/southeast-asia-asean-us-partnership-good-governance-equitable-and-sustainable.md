Southeast Asia has transformed from a region of political strife and poverty to a region of economic progress and increasing democracy, capped by the Association of South East Asian Nations' (ASEAN) ambitious plan for a fully integrated ASEAN community by 2015.

ASEAN-U.S. PROGRESS seizes this momentum and converges with the renewed U.S. focus on the region as a strategic economic and geopolitical partner. For ASEAN to achieve its own integration agenda and be a dynamic U.S. partner in regional and transnational challenges such as the fight against terrorism and promotion of good governance and human rights, ASEAN must have the institutional capability to muster and enhance its ability for collective action.

###  Sample Activities

* Help ASEAN strengthen linkages among its structures at the national and regional levels.
* Promote increased ASEAN engagement with the private sector, civil society, and the media.
* Improve capacity to combat transnational crimes and nontraditional security threats.
