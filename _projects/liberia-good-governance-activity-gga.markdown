Building on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s [Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-local-empowerment-government-inclusion-and-transparency-legit) and [Revenue Generation for Governance and Growth (RG3)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-revenue-generation-governance-and-growth-rg3) projects led by DAI—to support decentralization, local governance, and domestic resource mobilization in Liberia, GGA adds to this legacy a new component focused on budget transparency, anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability.
 
GGA aims to improve the capacities of select Government of Liberia ministries, agencies, and commissions to formulate and administer sound tax policies, improve budget transparency, deepen decentralization, and deliver high-quality services at the sub-national level. It will focus particularly on enhancing citizen participation to improve bottom-up and top-down transparency and accountability in governance at the national level and in three counties to be selected with USAID.
 
At the end of five years, GGA will have helped to establish the systems, implementation frameworks, and capacity for effective domestic resource mobilization, budget transparency, and decentralized governance. Citizens also will be more engaged in ensuring that their taxes are accounted for, and collectively these improvements should strengthen the social contract between Liberians and their governing institutions.
