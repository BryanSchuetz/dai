DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) is designing and implementing a flagship social investment initiative for a large Omani conglomerate. The national initiative will provide services to young people in multiple cities across Oman. 

DAI is designing a 2020 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Initiative comprised of two components: the anchor Muscat STEM Center that provides programming to schools and families in the city of Muscat, and the Traveling STEM Festival to reach communities outside of Muscat. 

DAI uses proven materials and curricula that have been used extensively in the United States and internationally, in countries such as Lebanon and South Korea. To reach the largest number of young Omanis, the 2020 STEM Initiative will include a range of programming with various levels of intensity. On one end, the Initiative will go wide, providing short STEM experiences and digital and analog resources for participants to use on their own. At the same time, the Initiative will go deep, creating STEM programs that require a higher time commitment from fewer participants who will develop deeper skills. In accordance with global best practices in STEM learning, all programs will focus on experiential, hands-on learning.
