DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) is designing and implementing a flagship social investment initiative for a large Omani conglomerate. The project will provide services to children across Oman. The STEMAzone Initiative will inspire young Omanis to enter STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) fields and set them on the STEMA pathway from an early age, which studies show is critical to building a skilled workforce. 

The STEMAzone is national in scope and implemented in partnership with the Oman Children’s Museum. Under this partnership, Oman’s Children Museum would serve as the anchor location in Muscat for the initiative, hosting visitors from the public and schools interested in engaging in STEAM-related activities, including coding, robotics, 3-D printing, and more. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project pivoted to a hybrid model combining in-person and virtual activities. The Virtual STEMAzone has online webinars and courses on a range of topics, accessible for free to students across Oman.
