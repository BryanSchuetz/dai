The Himaya Activity works to improve—and expand access to—essential services and protections for survivors of gender-based violence in Jordan.
 
Himaya has two objectives: 1) build the capacity of institutions charged with serving and protecting survivors of gender-based violence, emphasizing a survivor-centered approach; and 2) strengthen the legislative frameworks necessary to protect survivors and prevent and respond to gender-based violence.
 
The systems-strengthening work informs the research, advocacy, and policy changes, while reforms will over time be implemented and enforced by institutions and service providers newly strengthened.
