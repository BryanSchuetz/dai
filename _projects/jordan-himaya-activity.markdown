Jordanian survivors of gender-based violence face a multitude of challenges when going through the protection system. Survivors are often too intimidated to report their cases to the Family and Juvenile Protection Department due to fear of familial disapproval and social repercussions. Those who have gone have faced questioning and little protection, leading to revictimization and uncertainty about seeking other gender-based	services or resolutions. 

Service providers and stakeholders from across the Jordanian protection system require a refresher in survivor-centered service delivery methods, improved infrastructure, and innovation in gender-based violence response systems. 

The *Himaya* (Arabic for protection) Activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), improves protection for survivors of gender-based violence by enabling the USAID Mission in Jordan to provide technical and material assistance to improve national systems.

Himaya works to improve—and expand access to—essential services and protections for survivors of gender-based violence in Jordan.
 
Himaya has two objectives: 1) build the capacity of institutions charged with serving and protecting survivors of gender-based violence, emphasizing a survivor-centered approach; and 2) strengthen the legislative frameworks necessary to protect survivors and prevent and respond to gender-based violence.

The project supports gender-based violence survivors to receive essential services for their protection, healing, and recovery; contribute to a stronger evidence base to inform a sustainable, survivor-centered, and Jordanian-led protection system; and engage in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society to help improve gender equality indicators in Jordan.
