Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, small distributed energy companies are interested in learning where to invest in off-grid or mini-grid energy solutions. Often they are faced with a gap in knowledge about the markets they are trying to develop, and lean on the World Bank/IFC to provide basic information about energy access, socioeconomics, and demand. 

The Sustainable Business Group (SBG) designed a methodology for addressing these data needs to help ensure the World Bank/IFC has the information it needs to consult with clients, and investors can access relevant information and analyze potential opportunities.
