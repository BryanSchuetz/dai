DAI carried out a political economy analysis and technical assessment of five transboundary landscapes on behalf of the U.K. Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA). These landscapes—all identified as high-priority biodiversity hotspots—were located within and around the Kavango-Zambezi Conservation Area, Western Congo Basin, Lower Mekong, Andes/Amazon, and in Mesoamerica. The contract was awarded under the [EACDS Lot B mechanism](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-eacds).

We assessed the biophysical characteristics and potential of each landscape, identified factors affecting the political economy of the regions, and reviewed existing initiatives in the sector. The assessments were to help the client understand the key drivers and systemic issues affecting biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, which would, in turn, inform intervention strategies delivered under the Biodiverse Landscapes Fund.  

The Fund was launched by the U.K. Government in 2019 to tackle the “triple challenge” of poverty, catastrophic biodiversity loss, and the climate emergency. The government assigned £100 million in financing to the Fund, a seven-year program that works across transnational landscapes in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The focus is to protect and restore landscapes through sustainable development and environmental protection practices, thereby improving the quality of ecosystems and safeguarding against biodiversity loss.

### Sample Activities

* Assess the biophysical characteristics and potential of each landscape, factors affecting the political economy of the regions, and review existing initiatives and interventions in the sector. 
* Select, contract, and manage five teams of experts across the time zones.
* Design and adapt conceptual political economy analysis framework to each landscape and based on specific biodiversity-related problem statement (such as wildlife trade, logging, land conversion for subsistence agriculture, commercial farming, mining, people, and wildlife conflict, etc.).
* Carry out desk research and primary research including key informant interviews across 18 countries.
* Draft political economy analysis and technical assessments for each of the five transboundary landscapes.
* Scope out intervention strategies and present strategic case and plausible interventions in each of the landscapes.
* Carry out an economic appraisal of selected intervention pathways for each landscape.
