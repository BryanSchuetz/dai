Southeast Asia is home to some of the world’s most celebrated biodiversity and rich cultural traditions. The region is also a major global sourcing area of agricultural commodities; an estimated 90 percent of the world’s rubber, 86 percent of palm oil used globally, and 30 percent of the world’s rice are grown in the region. Additionally, Vietnam and Indonesia are two of the top coffee-producing countries in the world, grown primarily by smallholder farmers. Agricultural expansion has led to rapid deforestation and ecosystem degradation, creating an urgent need to address the interrelated climate and biodiversity crises. The path to decarbonization will require a collective response to climate change with major investments in agricultural supply chains and shared sourcing landscapes to not only transform business as usual, but also deliver equitable benefits to local communities for long-term sustainability. 

As part of this response, the U.S. Agency for International Development created the Partnerships for Green Investment program, which employs nature-based solutions to achieve greater emissions reduction, climate resilience, biodiversity protection, inclusiveness, and benefit sharing across Southeast Asia.
 
Focusing on Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, PAGI works to advance systemic change in the agricultural, forestry, and other land use sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at scale through inclusive and sustainable approaches, thereby accelerating the region’s transition to net-zero economies.
