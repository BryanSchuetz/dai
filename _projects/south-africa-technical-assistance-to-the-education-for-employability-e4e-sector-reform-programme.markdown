Although South Africa devotes a relatively high proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) to education and training, the country faces challenges such as high dropout rates, low pass rates, and high youth unemployment rates. 

The Education for Employability (E4E) Sector Reform Programme creates more inclusive, equitable, and quality education and employment prospects for South African youth. E4E supports the government’s efforts in improving the quality of basic education, vocational training, and job placement services from early childhood through teenage years until the acquisition of skills needed for the world of work.

Our team supports the National Treasury and three key implementing government departments in the design, administration, and implementation of E4E. The project develops institutional capacity as well as provides management and operational support. 

### Sample Activities

* Strengthen the Department of Employment and Labour, Department of Basic Education, and Department of Higher Education and Training to deliver the outputs and intended outcomes of E4E.
* Improve collaboration and increased coordination between the three departments and the National Treasury towards the achievement of more inclusive, equitable, and quality education and employment prospects for South African youth.
* Provide programme management and operational support, including secretarial support for the governance structures, coordination, and alignment of systems among the three involved departments and other stakeholders, including the grants implemented by civil society and coordination of donor support to establish synergies with other projects.
