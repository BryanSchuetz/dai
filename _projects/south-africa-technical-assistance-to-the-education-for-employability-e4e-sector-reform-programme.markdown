Although South Africa devotes a relatively high proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) to education and training, the country faces challenges such as high dropout rates, low pass rates, and high youth unemployment rates. 

The Education for Employability (E4E) Sector Reform Programme has been set up to create more inclusive, equitable and quality education and employment prospects for South African youth. The programme supports the government’s efforts in improving the quality of basic education, vocational training and job placement services from early childhood, through teenage years until the acquisition of skills needed for the world-of-work.
Our project team provides technical assistance to support the National Treasury and three key implementing government departments in the design, administration and  implementation of the E4E Programme. The project develops institutional capacity as well as provides management and operational support. 
Sample Activities
•	Strengthen the three sector departments (Department of Employment and Labour, Department of Basic Education, and Department of Higher Education and Training) to deliver the outputs and intended outcomes of the E4E Programme.
•	Improve collaboration and increased coordination between the three sector departments and the National Treasury towards the achievement of more inclusive, equitable and quality education and employment prospects for South African youth.
•	Provide programme management and operational support, including secretarial support for the governance structures, coordination and alignment of systems among the three involved departments and other stakeholders, including the grants implemented by civil society and coordination of donor support to establish synergies with other projects.
