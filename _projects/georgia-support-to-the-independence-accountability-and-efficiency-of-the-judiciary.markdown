Georgia has undergone extensive judicial reform to increase judicial independence, accountability, efficiency, and transparency. These efforts have culminated in a wave of judicial reforms, detailed in the Draft Organic Law of Georgia on Entering Amendments to the Organic Law of Georgia on Common Courts. Key reforms concerning the selection, promotion, and transfer of judges and judicial integrity are addressed, alongside structural changes in the High School of Justice and Supreme Court to strengthen judicial independence.

The EuropeAid project Support to the Independence, Accountability, and Efficiency of the Judiciary Georgia, led by DAI Human Dynamics, assists with ensuring the impartiality and professionalism of the judiciary towards being free from political or any other undue interference in Georgia.
