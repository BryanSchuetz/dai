The Edo State Government has a vision of transforming Edo State into a high-performing, progressive, and self-sufficient state, and recognizes that civil service is the critical delivery engine of government for this process. The State Government established the John Odigie Oyegun Public Service Academy (JOOPSA), to serve as a platform to train its public service to deliver high-value services to citizens and accelerate other reforms.

DAI is operationalizing JOOPSA by developing procedures, programs, strategies, and a sustainability roadmap that meets the present and future needs of the state public service. We are providing technical assistance to identify and establish the Academy’s necessary building blocks—including service offerings, governance and organizational structure, standard operating procedures, credible faculty, competent staff, necessary infrastructure, linkages to key training institutions, and fit-for-purpose programs—and to design appropriate sustainability mechanisms.
