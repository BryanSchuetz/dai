The Fleming Fund is a U.K Department of Health and Social Care programme to help low- and middle-income countries fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR is a leading cause of death globally, [research shows](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00087-3/fulltext) that 1.27 million deaths annually are attributable to drug resistance, higher than HIV/AIDS or malaria. DAI’s [Fleming Fund programme](https://www.flemingfund.org/) in Bangladesh is a collaboration with the Bangladesh government to strengthen systems using a “One Health” approach—a multisectoral approach to complex health problems that reaches across human health, animal health, and environment sectors. As global leaders in the approach, DAI helps incorporate One Health across programme interventions. DAI is helping Bangladesh become a leader in combating AMR, and a model for better management of antimicrobials in human and animal populations.  

Fleming Fund Bangladesh partners include Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, The International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.
