The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already precarious economic and governance conditions in Jordan. In 2021, unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The confluence of the pandemic and recurrent economic crisis has caused municipal revenues to decline sharply. 

Mayors and municipal councilors, as the face of government accountability and public spending, assume outsized responsibility for government performance. However, with limited authority, these officials are not empowered to make decisions and set funding priorities. Many municipalities have the basic building blocks needed to strengthen services and pursue local economic development but lack the organizational culture required to apply them effectively. Recognizing that municipalities should serve as convenors, enablers, and facilitators of local economic development, mayors and municipal councilors must partner with the private sector and remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment, job creation, and local economic growth. Municipalities must capitalize on their existing assets in partnership with the private sector, while also delivering more efficient services that are responsive to community needs.  

The USAID Municipal Support Program (MSP) works with municipalities across the Kingdom of Jordan to strengthen local administration and service delivery, increase capital investment, and pursue local economic development.  

MSP assists individual municipalities while simultaneously implementing systemwide interventions that aim to transform the way municipalities do business—from financial management to climate mitigation and adaptation to private sector engagement. MSP supports municipal “clusters,” in which multiple municipalities share tools and resources to better serve their communities by utilizing improved systems and delivering visibly enhanced services and infrastructure. 

Municipalities in each cluster collaborate with one another, with other Jordanian government stakeholders, and with the private sector to leverage and invest in existing assets that deliver cost-effective, sustainable services and economic growth. The project also facilitates the launch and sustainable management of private investments and public-private partnerships that deliver community-responsive services, mobilize revenue, and generate employment in municipalities.
