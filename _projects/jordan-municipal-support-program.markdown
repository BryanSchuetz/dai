The Jordan Municipal Support Program improves local government service delivery, stimulates local economic development, and thereby strengthens the social contract in the Kingdom.
 
The project assists 10 or more municipal “clusters”—in which multiple municipalities share tools and resources—to better serve their communities by delivering visibly improved services and infrastructure. Each cluster enhances and sustainably manages high-priority services that directly support economic development. Municipalities in each cluster will collaborate with one another, with other Jordanian government stakeholders, and with the private sector to leverage and invest in existing assets that deliver cost-effective, sustainable services and economic growth.

The project will facilitate the launch and sustainable management of private investments and public-private partnerships that deliver community-responsive services, mobilize revenue, and generate employment. Successful service improvements and investments will build momentum for sustained individual and organizational transformation, sparking replication of successful tools and approaches that build community resilience and foster a culture of municipal excellence that embraces private enterprise and pursues local economic growth
