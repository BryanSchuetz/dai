We are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded the Lebanon Water, Sanitation, and Conservation (WSC) Project.
 
Drawing and building on the successes achieved by the Lebanon Water Project (LWP), WSC will engage citizens and the private sector to enhance their water stewardship, increase efficiency in the protection of water resources, and improve water and wastewater services to around 600,000 people by expanding the capacity of public water utilities and local governments to treat wastewater.
 
Led by Chief of Party Scott Short, WSC will increase the volumes of wastewater treated, reduce the pollution and water losses that harm water sources, improve service delivery to citizens, and facilitate partnerships between public water utilities, municipalities, the private sector, civil society organizations, and citizen groups to introduce innovative solutions and improve governance in the water and wastewater sector across Lebanon.
 
The DAI team is proud to include subcontractors Aguas de Portugal, American University of Beirut, Cross Boundary, and NJOY.
 
DAI’s fourth consecutive USAID water project in Lebanon, the WSC win is a testament to DAI’s successes in the Lebanese water sector and in particular reflects USAID’s appreciation of LWP’s achievements. Thanks and many congratulations to everyone who contributed to the win.
