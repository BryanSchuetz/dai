Despite ample natural water sources, Lebanon is a country in a state of “water impoverishment.” Inefficient water resources management and deficient wastewater management capacity are jeopardizing the health of the Lebanese people and overwhelming the environment. An acute economic crisis, the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 [Beirut port explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion) worsened the situation. 

Drawing on the work achieved by the [Lebanon Water Project (LWP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/lebanon-water-project-lwp), the Lebanon Water, Sanitation, and Conservation (WSC) Project engages citizens and the private sector to enhance their water stewardship, increase efficiency in the protection of water resources, and improve water and wastewater services to around 600,000 people by expanding the capacity of public water utilities and local governments to treat wastewater.
