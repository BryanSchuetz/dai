In 2014, the Government of Jordan responded to the King's call for a 10-year economic blueprint for meeting a set of challenging objectives. Key among the objectives was "to enhance policies related to human resources, link education policies to labor market demands, focus on building a labor force through vocational training, especially youth, so that they gradually replace guest labor, and encourage women to join the labor market."

The Jordan Workforce Development Project [directly addresses ][1]this objective. WFD works to create a competitive, demand-driven workforce development system that leads to increased private sector employment, especially for women, youth, and those living at or below the poverty line.

###  Sample Activities

* Pilot vocational training centers as "innovation hubs" for local communities.
* Develop improved and new certification/accreditation of targeted technical and vocational professions.
* Increase the number of public-private partnerships for job placement.
* Implement a career guidance system for vocational education students.
* Work with employers and business associations to implement alternative arrangements to facilitate more women being able to work, such as flex hours and part-time hours.

###  Select Results

* Trained 20 participants on test development and administration for the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Supervisor training course. The workshops also resulted in a CAQA-approved national OSH curriculum framework.
* Developed a "Work Ready Now" tool  to assess the existing gap in soft skills training in curricula currently in use by Jordan's Vocational Training Corporation. The tool supports WFD in developing the Instructor Professional Development Program and in enhancing and strengthening Jordan's Vocational Technical Institute curricula.
