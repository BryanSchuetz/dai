Sustainable Economic Transformation (SET) supports sustainable economic opportunities and investment in various vulnerable areas of Colombia, fostering growth, development, and peace implementation in an equitable and environmentally sustainable manner, in line with USAID's Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS). This project aims to make rural economies increasingly competitive, economically diverse, and resilient to economic and climate-related disruptions, which is essential for lasting peace.

While climate change continues to threaten the livelihoods of the most vulnerable, it also presents opportunities for innovation in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, including crop diversification. If economic interventions are carried out considering adaptation and mitigation, they will enhance rural incomes and reduce environmental impact.

SET have two objectives:

•	Increase the growth and diversification of rural businesses.
•	Improve the environment for rural economic competitiveness.

The geographical coverage of SET is divided into 4 regions where strategic regional corridors will be established.

•	Western Region: It comprises the departments of Cauca and Nariño with 13 municipalities, distributed in the Cauca and Nariño Pacific, the Cauca Mountain range, and northern Cauca.
•	Central Region: It comprises the departments of Meta and Guaviare with 7 municipalities, distributed in southern Meta and 75% of the municipalities of the Guaviare department.
•	Southern Region: It comprises the middle and lower Putumayo, focusing on prioritization in 7 municipalities.
•	Northern Region: It comprises 3 municipalities in the department of La Guajira.
