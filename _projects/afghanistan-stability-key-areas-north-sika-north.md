SIKA-North worked to create more resilient communities in Afghanistan that see their government officials as delivering public services and responsive to local problems. This is critical to stability, as Afghans generally assert that government effectiveness improves their personal sense of predictability, community resilience, and physical security.

The project worked with district officials to plan, design, implement, and monitor projects targeted at improving service provision and stability.

## Sample Activities

* Identify sources of instability using the Stability Analysis Mechanism tool that enables districts to pinpoint issues that undermine peace, predictability, and productivity.
* Build Stability Working Groups of key local Afghans who host forums and together identify and discuss district sources of instability.
* Promote district-level communication among government and nongovernment stakeholders to more efficiently create localized stability-based activities.
* Build capacity at entities such as District Development Assemblies to address the sources of instability, provide services to their communities, and improve provincial-district coordination.
* Support activities designed by district entities that mitigate local sources of instability.
