Despite greater economic stability since 2000, Honduras has yet to significantly improve living conditions or reduce poverty for much of its citizenry. The inability of local governments to provide effective public services to their citizens has emerged as a key barrier to tackling the inter-related challenges of sluggish economic development and a lack of trust in the democratic system. Furthermore, poor governance and poor accountability at the local level serve to exacerbate border issues such as the rise of organized crime and surges of migration to the United States.

In this climate, the U.S. Agency for International Development has designed the Honduras Local Governance (HLG) project to enhance public service delivery as well as increase the transparency, accountability, and responsiveness of local governments. HLG works in 80 municipalities in six departments in western Honduras to address entrenched socioeconomic challenges related to food security, climate vulnerability, and gender disparity to sustainably improve the lives of the Honduran people.

HLG engages multiple governance stakeholders, including municipal and state agencies, mayors, city council members, civil society organizations, and national-level institutions, to develop better service delivery policies. The program also ensures that citizens see the tangible benefits of democratic engagement by first working to understand the unique needs and priorities of local populations in each partner municipality, and then supporting local governments to effectively respond through targeted training and grant assistance.
