Honduras' persistently high levels of crime, impunity, and corruption continue to plague citizens who remain frustrated that the government is not delivering justice effectively or protecting the most vulnerable. Many systemic challenges contribute to low levels of human and physical security in the Northern Triangle region as a whole and cause Honduran citizens to pursue irregular migration to leave the country. 

Representing the next generation of justice reform and anticorruption programming in Honduras, the Justicia Efectiva Contra la Criminalidad y Corrupción project (Effective Justice to Combat Criminality and Corruption (JECCC)) combats impunity and corruption by targeting crime and by promoting collaboration among justice institutions and counterparts from civil society, the private sector, academia, and other nonstate actors. This holistic approach strengthens the criminal justice system and will ultimately lead to increased citizen confidence and reduce push factors for irregular migration.
 
JECCC aims to deliver marked improvement in the investigation, prosecution, and resolution of targeted crimes; a significant increase in access to justice among vulnerable populations (emphasizing young people, women, and returnees); and better institutional and civil society oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability.
