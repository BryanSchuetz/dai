The 15-country Southern African Development Community (SADC) region—including government, private sector, and civil society—is realizing the advantages of greater regional and global trade linkages and export-oriented business development. Led by prime contractor AECOM, the Southern Africa Trade Hub (SATH) project is advancing this regional integration agenda and increasing the trade capacity of regional value chains in selected sectors. Particular attention is being given to moving primary products, such as staple foods, more easily from surplus to deficit areas, thereby alleviating food insecurity. Identifying specific constraints along value chains enables interested parties to focus on their removal. Further, while each element of the value chain operates within a particular country, costs often relate to cross-border policies and regulations. DAI is helping to implement a regional approach that will build a broader coalition for reforms, exert peer pressure for implementation, and raise awareness of best practices.
