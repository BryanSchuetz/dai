Least-developed countries are experiencing rapid levels of urbanisation and population growth, which is putting pressure on the already limited resources and increases the need for sustainable infrastructure. The EU, which represents less than 10 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions, has made it a priority to accelerate a global transition towards carbon neutrality, particularly in urban development. 

The first-ever EU Urban Development Technical Facility focuses on supporting EU partner countries in their urban development challenges. It delivers high-level technical assistance and policy advice to improve the quality and impact of the EU’s interventions in urban development at a local, regional and global level, with a focus on Africa, as well as Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia. Integrated urban planning coupled with greener infrastructure and coordinated urban expansion can increase a city's urban resilience while minimizing the negative environmental impacts of human settlement. 

Our team will provide advisory, analytical and technical reviews for greater coordination and alignment on sustainable urban development; increasing knowledge capitalization and dissemination within the European Commission, development partners and partner countries; and providing operational support to the EU Platform for Urban Development. These activities will contribute to achieving the objectives of the EU Green Deal, the EU Global Gateway initiative, the New Urban Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals, while also supporting digital transformation, sustainable growth and jobs, good governance, human development, and migration management.

## Sample Activities

* Provide technical assistance to EC and EU Delegations in supporting sustainable urban development related actions in partner countries, including the designing and implementation of programmes on sustainable cities, advise on public strategies to increase policy dialog with partner countries, and provide guidance to Delegations or partners on how to mainstream urban development aspects into interventions.
* Increase knowledge on the different levels of sustainability in the context of urban development to share with EU Commission, development partners and partner countries, through the organisation of meetings and events, conducting research and supporting the development of knowledge on gender equality and human rights-based approach in urban development areas. 
* Develop an EU Platform as a new forum for greater coordination and alignment on sustainable urban development.
