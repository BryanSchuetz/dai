OTP Banka Slovensko is an institution that has historically focused on corporate lending. In 2005, the bank looked to diversify its portfolio and decided to incorporate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending into its strategy. DAI was asked to redesign the analysis and approval process to meet the realities of the SME sector. We assisted in the restructuring process, developed new investment loan products, and automated the decision-making process. Under this program, the bank developed the "Progress Loan," an SME product that allowed conditional approval within 48 hours of the bank receiving all appropriate documentation. DAI delivered a time management course aimed at OTP senior management, and a sales skills training for the lenders, supported by intensive on-the-job and individual training that included tutorials on how to manage client interviews. We also contributed to an OTP-led marketing initiative involving SME roadshows across the country, and we designed and implemented incentive schemes for middle managers, and planned further marketing activities aimed at supporting new SME loan products.

###  Sample Activities

* Develop a new SME lending methodology and products, credit scoring model, and marketing plan.
* Train bank staff on credit analysis, financial forecasting, sales and marketing, and portfolio monitoring.
* Develop institutional capacity through training of trainers and mentors among bank staff.
* Devise an innovative program of non-monetary incentives.
* Mentor bank staff on day-to-day lending decisions.
