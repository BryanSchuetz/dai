DAI’s [Human Dynamics](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-acquires-leading-european-development-consultancy-human-dynamics) supports the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in implementing the Community Driven Local Development (KP-CDLD) Programme in the 13 districts of the province of Pakistan. The programme works to build the responsiveness and effectiveness of the province’s administration to restore citizen trust; stimulate employment and livelihood opportunities; and ensure delivery of basic services. 

By following a decentralized and bottom-up approach, the province aims to achieve sustainable improvement in the coverage and quality of frontline service delivery through actively involving local communities. The European Union supports the government by providing budget support and funding this [technical assistance project](http://www.cdldta.pk/) as a complementary measure to build capacities on provincial, district, and town levels with regard to policy review and feedback, public financial management, procurement and contract management, communication and visibility, engineering standards, and monitoring and evaluation.
