DAI’s [Human Dynamics](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-acquires-leading-european-development-consultancy-human-dynamics) supports the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in implementing the Community Driven Local Development (KP-CDLD) Programme in the 12 districts of the province of Pakistan. The programme aims to restore community trust in the local government and build government responsiveness. 

[KP-CDLD](http://www.cdldta.pk/) was first initiated in six districts of Malakand Division, engaging with community-based organisations to multiply impact. In 2017 and 2018 the geographic coverage was extended to other six districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: Battagram, Buner, Haripur, Nowshera, Swabi, and Torghar. The project seeks to ensure that local authorities achieve targets; build capacity in public financial management, procurement, and other areas; and develop appropriate mechanisms for management information and policy feedback. 

Given the wide geographical distribution of trainees and their different roles—civil servants of line departments, elected council members, appointed local government officers, and members of community organisations—our approach demands effective coordination, marshaling of resources, and the ability to conceive solutions across varied socio-geographic areas.
