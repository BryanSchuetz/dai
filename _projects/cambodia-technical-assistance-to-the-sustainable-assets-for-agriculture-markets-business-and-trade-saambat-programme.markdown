The Technical Assistance to the Sustainable Assets for Agriculture Markets, Business and Trade (SAAMBAT) programme in Cambodia aims to reduce multidimensional poverty by developing a better connected, more climate resilient, and more equitable rural economy in Cambodia. It looks to improve connectivity, reduce production and marketing costs, increase private sector investment, and boost the productivity of farmers, focusing on value chain infrastructure and in particular rural road infrastructure (component 1) and skills, technology, and enterprise (component 2).

The DAI-led consortium (with partners Gopa Infra and TAS Euro) supports the Ministry of Rural Development with capacity-building activities for rural road rehabilitation.

## Sample Activities

* Support rural road safety.
* Develop environmental and social safeguarding frameworks
* Promote climate change resilience and adaptation.
