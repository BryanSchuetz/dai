The Transforming Education in Pakistan (TEP) programme is developing and implementing a public advocacy campaign in Pakistan to ensure that parents and civil society groups support quality education. _Alif Ailaan_ is the brand name for the three-year campaign, based on a decade-long engagement between the U.K. Department for International Development and education stakeholders in Pakistan that essentially determined the need for a dramatic change in the level of active political engagement on education issues. The theory of change for the project is that a greater degree of political salience for education is a prerequisite for any transformational change to take place in education in Pakistan.

There are five core strands that the campaign depends on to enhance education's standing in the mainstream political discourse: Direct political advocacy, the media, civil society and direct community engagement, research and evidence and finally, the international community. Several pioneering efforts have been tested by the _Alif Ailaan_ campaign, which is already recognised as a trailblazer in areas such as education and school infrastructure league tables for districts, cross-platform activism, and engaging senior journalists and politicians.

###  Sample Activities

* Design and implement a public advocacy campaign, a media strategy that reaches out to target groups with clear messages; an online data observatory where evidence can be published and accessed easily by parents, teachers, and civil society organizations.
* Elicit engagement from key stakeholders, nongovernmental organisations, and education champions.
