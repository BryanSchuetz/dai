Like with its successful [PolSEFF][1] and [WebSEFF][2] projects in Poland and the Western Balkans, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in cooperation with in cooperation with the French Agency for Development, European Investment Bank, and KfW Development Bank, has extended credit lines to local partner financial institutions in Morocco that then on-lend to their clients. These clients—small business and corporate borrowers—use this financing to invest in efficient and renewable energy equipment and services that decrease their carbon footprints and improve their bottom lines.

The credit line for Morocco is currently €20million for Banque Marocaine du Commerce Extérieur, but more financial institutions are expected to join the facility soon. DAI is assisting the EBRD and partner financial institutions to develop loan products. This new demand will also spur the development of a local production base for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.

###  Sample Activities

* Provide partner financial institutions with technical assistance in developing marketing strategies and activities to build customer awareness and fill the pipeline with clean-energy projects.
* Work with other agencies—including government, business associations, and development finance institutions—to promote the facility.
* Train local engineers, energy auditors, architects, and designers to identify and prepare bankable sustainable energy projects.
