Poland is one of the most energy-intensive economies in Europe and the Polish government identified increased energy efficiency as one of its top priorities when developing the country's long-term energy policy. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (ERBD) [Polish Residential Energy Efficiency Financing Facility](http://www.polreff.org/?sLanguage=en) (Poland REFF) addresses this goal through a program of targeted loans to incentivize borrowing for household improvements that increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

Over the course of the project, the ERBD will disperse €200 million through local banks in Poland to borrowers ranging from single-family households to commercial residential developers and property owners. DAI, as a subcontractor to the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency, provides technical assistance to support the implementation of the facility.

Poland REFF builds on the success of the DAI-led [Polish Sustainable Energy Financing Facility](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/poland-polish-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-polseff) (PolSEFF), which provided similar energy efficiency financing to small and medium enterprises.
