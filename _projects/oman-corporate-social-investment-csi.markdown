DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) conducted a social investment benchmarking study for a multinational corporation in Oman, in two phases. Phase 1 was a two-week desktop benchmarking study of seven companies in Oman to provide insights into corporate social investment (CSI) trends. Phase 2 focused on in-country data collection and analysis. The findings will inform a short-term CSI “bridging” strategy and provide foundational data for a multiyear strategy.
