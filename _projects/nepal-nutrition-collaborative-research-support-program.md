Preparing food for children ages 6-24 months takes a lot of mothers' time, which is often limited by other responsibilities. In low-income neighborhoods of Kathmandu, Nepal, there is minimal supply of but high demand for processed, affordable, and nutritious weaning foods that incorporate multiple food groups.

Tufts University, DAI, and Right Direction Nepal are assisting a Kathmandu-based cottage industry that produces foods that complement breast feeding. The goal: help this cottage industry to produce processed (quick and easy) weaning food for infants and toddlers at higher quality and nutrition, higher volume, and lower cost.

###  ![][1]Sample Activities

* Assist the cottage industry in auditing its production, packaging, and distribution systems.
* Train in business planning.
* Improve development of processed, fortified complementary foods.
* Conduct market analysis of complementary foods in the Kathmandu area; the forthcoming report and recommendations will guide DAI's and Right Direction Nepal's work with the cottage industry group.
