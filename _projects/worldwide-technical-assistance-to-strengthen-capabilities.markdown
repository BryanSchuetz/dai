The Technical Assistance to Strengthen Capabilities Project (TASC) aims to contribute to improved nutritional outcomes as part of the Technical Assistance for Nutrition (TAN) Programme funded by UK Aid. TAN works to improve coverage of multi-sectoral nutrition interventions to drive improvements in health and nutrition status within countries. TAN aims to achieve this by strengthening the enabling environment for nutrition at the global and country levels and strengthening the capacity of countries within the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, ultimately delivering policies and programmes that support the reduction of malnutrition. 

To sustain and expand action on nutrition, TASC provides demand-driven technical assistance services in two components:

* Component 1: Assistance to governments in the SUN Movement and the SUN Movement Secretariat to catalyse efforts to scale up nutrition impact.
* Component 2: Assistance to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) Nutrition Policy Unit and FCDO country offices to maximise the quality and effectiveness of their nutrition-related policy and programmes, to support evidence generation and lesson learning and to develop nutrition capacity.

TASC is led by DAI with [NutritionWorks](https://www.nutritionworks.org.uk/) and [Development Initiatives](https://www.devinit.org/) as consortium partners, and is a follow-on to the [Maximising the Quality of Scaling Up Nutrition Plus (MQSUN+)](https://mqsunplus.path.org/) programme. 

TASC works collaboratively with [Nutrition International](https://www.nutritionintl.org/project/technical-assistance-for-nutrition-tan-project/), a key implementing partner under the TAN programme, to engage in joint learning and coordinate efforts on knowledge management.

## Sample Activities

* Analyse finance for nutrition actions (e.g. costing of multi-sectoral plans, budget analysis, and financial tracking)
* Support transition to the SUN Movement 3.0 Strategy (2021-2025)
* Conduct multi-country reviews of nutrition plans. 
* Support SUN Movement’s learning agenda.
* Support FCDO on nutrition-related programme design and implementation (development of strategic cases; programme review; placement of consultants to boost technical capacity on nutrition; and other technical support)
* Facilitate knowledge management, learning, and capacity building (case studies, a COVID-19 tracker with monthly updates, various technical guidance notes, webinars for FCDO staff, and wider audiences, etc.)

### Select Results

* Developed a [guidance note](https://socialprotection.org/discover/publications/space-how-promote-better-nutrition-through-social-assistance-guidance-note) to inform the design or adaptation of social assistance interventions to make them more nutrition-sensitive, highlighting good practices and key considerations for achieving better nutritional outcomes at three levels: policy, programme design, and implementation.
* Supported FCDO to identify, quantify, and understand its [Official Development Assistance (ODA) spending](https://devinit.org/blog/latest-data-uk-fcdo-nutrition-spending/) on nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programmes, as well as its performance against the Nutrition for Growth (N4G) commitments made in 2012. 
* Conducted a [systematic review](https://scalingupnutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SUN-Country-National-Nutrition-Plans_May2021.pdf) of 13 national nutrition plans based on the revised SUN checklist from 2020 of best practices. The review sought to identify common strengths, areas for further development and actionable recommendations to inform next steps or improve future planning. 
* Continued implementing a monthly evidence tracker started under MQSUN+. [This tracker](https://assetify-dai.com/resource-library/C19_Tracker_Core_Report_April.pdf) identifies and summarises the emerging data and evidence, including non-traditional data sources, to improve understanding of how COVID-19 is indirectly affecting nutrition in low- and middle-income countries and of the global and national responses being employed to address this impact.
