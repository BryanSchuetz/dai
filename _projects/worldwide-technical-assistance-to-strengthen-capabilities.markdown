The Technical Assistance to Strengthen Capabilities Project (TASC) aims to contribute to improved nutritional outcomes as part of the Technical Assistance for Nutrition (TAN) Programme funded by UKaid. TAN works to improve coverage of multi-sectoral nutrition interventions to drive improvements in health and nutrition status within countries. TAN aims to achieve this by strengthening the enabling environment for nutrition at the global and country levels and strengthening the capacity of countries within the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, ultimately delivering policies and programmes that support the reduction of malnutrition. 

To sustain and expand action on nutrition, TASC provides demand-driven technical assistance services in two components:

* Component 1: Assistance to governments in the SUN Movement and the SUN Movement Secretariat to catalyse efforts to scale up nutrition impact.
* Component 2: Assistance to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) Nutrition Policy Unit and FCDO country offices to maximise the quality and effectiveness of their nutrition-related policy and programmes, to support evidence generation and lesson learning and to develop nutrition capacity.

TASC is led by DAI with [NutritionWorks](https://www.nutritionworks.org.uk/) and [Development Initiatives](https://www.devinit.org/) as consortium partners, and is a follow-on to the [Maximising the Quality of Scaling Up Nutrition Plus (MQSUN+)](https://mqsunplus.path.org/) programme. 

TASC works collaboratively with [Nutrition International](https://www.nutritionintl.org/project/technical-assistance-for-nutrition-tan-project/), a key implementing partner under the TAN programme, to engage in joint learning and coordinate efforts on knowledge management.
