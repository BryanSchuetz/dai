Georgia is a small country located at the crossroads of Asia and Europe on a vital trading and transit route for goods and services. In recent years, Georgia signed free trade agreements that greatly expand Georgia's market access. The USAID Economic Security Program aims to assist Georgian firms to take advantage of the country’s market access and location to exploit regional economic opportunities and compete with international competitors for Georgia's domestic market.

Georgia ESP will focus on enterprises outside of agriculture that show strong potential to create jobs, increase incomes, and increase revenues, as well as support diversification to more productive economic activities, including the tourism sector and up to three additional sectors. DAI will apply a facilitative value chain development approach that places market actors and other value chain stakeholders (public and private) at the center of the change process, inviting them to define problems and co-create solutions. Using timebound “smart incentives,” Georgia ESP will then co-invest with market actors in their own pro-growth solutions.
