Georgia is a small country at the crossroads of Asia and Europe on a vital trading and transit route for goods and services. In recent years, Georgia signed free trade agreements that greatly expand Georgia's market access. The USAID Economic Security Program assists Georgian firms to take advantage of the country’s market access and location to exploit regional economic opportunities and compete with international competitors for Georgia's domestic market.

The USAID Economic Security Program focuses on enterprises outside of agriculture that show strong potential to create jobs, increase incomes, and increase revenues, as well as support diversification to more productive economic activities, including tourism, light manufacturing, creative industries, shared intellectual services, and solid waste management sectors. 
DAI applies a facilitative value chain development approach that places market actors and other value chain stakeholders (public and private) at the center of the change process, inviting them to define problems and co-create solutions. Using timebound “smart incentives,” the program then co-invests with market actors in their own pro-growth solutions.

The program intends to create at least 4,800 new jobs, support at least 720 small firms, increase sales of assisted enterprises by $60 million, and leverage $18 million in partnerships leveraged through partnerships.
