The [EU Support to Immunisation Governance in Nigeria (EU-SIGN)](https://eu-sign.org/) project improving routine immunisation, maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) by protecting children and their mothers from vaccine preventable diseases. Focused on strengthening the governance of immunisation programming and systems at national, state, and local government authority (LGA) levels, EU-SIGN works with stakeholders to shore up the systems and resource deployment necessary to improve routine immunization. It works to align governance and accountability in immunisation with stewardship transformation in the Nigerian health care sector.

Funded by the European Union, the project strengthens the governance of routine immunisation at the federal level and across 23 states.

The project works closely with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its state counterparts to ensure sustainable quality routine immunisation services.

### Sample Activities

* Craft policies and guidelines for primary health care.
* Improve delivery of routine immunisation services via the primary health care system including building infrastructure, supporting transportation solutions, and updating necessary cold chain equipment.
* Improve information and knowledge generation for routine immunisation including operational or implementation research to drive policies and planning.
* Assist World Health Organisation-supported effort to accelerate the reduction in the wild polio virus transmission in Nigeria. 

Conseil Sante, in partnership with DAI Global Health, manages the contract and provides technical assistance to the NPHCDA to support and enhance its capacity to effectively manage and utilize European Development Fund (EDF) resources under the SIGN project.
