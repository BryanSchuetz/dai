The EU Support to Immunisation Governance in Nigeria (EU-SIGN) project is improving maternal newborn and child health (MNCH) in Nigeria by protecting children along and their mothers from vaccine preventable diseases. Focused on strengthening the governance of immunisation programming at State and Local Government Area levels, EU-SIGN works with stakeholders to shore up the systems and resource deployment necessary to improve routine immunization. It seeks to align governance and accountability in immunisation with stewardship transformation in the Nigerian health sector.

Funded by the European Union, initially for a period of three years, the project will strengthen the governance of routine immunisation at the Federal level (Abuja FCT) and across 23 States (Abia, AkwaIbom, Anambra, Bauchi, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara).

The project works closely with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its State level counterparts to ensure sustainable quality routine immunisation services are permanently available through:

effective management systems , policies and guidelines for primary health care;
improved delivery of routine immunization services via the primary health care system including infrastructure, transport and equipment; and,
improved information and knowledge generation for routine immunisation including operational or implementation research to drive policies and planning.
The project also contributes to Nigerian Polio Eradication by assisting the WHO-supported effort to accelerate the reduction in the wild polio virus transmission in Nigeria to less than five case per annum by the end of 2014. 

Conseil Sante, in partnership with Health Partners International, is managing the contract and providing technical assistance to the NPHCDA to support and enhance the capacity of the NPHCDA to effectively manage and utilize European Development Fund (EDF) resources under the SIGN project.

Watch a short video clip below from the first biannual meeting of the Senior Technical Advisers.  The meeting was an opportunity to share lessons learned from the past year, review the new workplan, share experiences from each of the states on technical and administrative issues, and to receive updates from the NPHCDA, EU-SIGN and other immunization partners.
