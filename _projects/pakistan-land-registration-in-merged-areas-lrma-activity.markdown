The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Settlement and Land Record project is a major commitment to the people of the province’s Merged Areas. The commitment is not only in terms of monetary and human resources—it is a commitment to provide the economic, social, and gender equity benefits of secure land tenure and property rights to the people of the MAs. By so doing, the project is a crucial contribution to overcoming the economic and social development lags of the MAs and extending to them the writ of the government.  

The GoKP’s Revenue and Estate Department’s PC-1 document assigns to USAID challenging functions critical to achieving the project’s broad objectives. USAID’s Land Registration in Merged Areas (LRMA) Activity reflects USAID’s acceptance of responsibility for those functions. Even more, it reflects USAID’s acceptance of responsibility for three outcomes—specified in the LRMA statement of objectives—that cannot be achieved unless both USAID and the GoKP do their parts. This will require USAID’s implementing partner to equip the GoKP with the human and institutional capacity it requires and to lay a groundwork of trust among the people of the MAs for the GoKP’s actions.  



The Land Registration in Merged Areas (LRMA) Activity is establishing a land record and registration system in seven districts of the Merged Areas (formerly the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) of northwestern Pakistan so that citizens, families, landowners, investors, banks, and government actors have access to accurate, understandable, and current records of their land rights. 
 
LRMA strengthens the legal framework that supports access to accurate ownership and title records, equitable rights recognition, dispute resolution systems (both formal and informal), collateralization of land, and the private use of government land for revenue generation and economic development.
