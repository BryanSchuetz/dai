The Land Registration in Merged Areas (LRMA) Activity is establishing a land record and registration system in seven districts of the Merged Areas (formerly the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) of northwestern Pakistan so that citizens, families, landowners, investors, banks, and government actors have access to accurate, understandable, and current records of their land rights. 
 
Led by Chief of Party Muhammad Shoaib, LRMA will strengthen the legal framework that supports access to accurate ownership and title records, equitable rights recognition, dispute resolution systems (both formal and informal), collateralization of land, and the private use of government land for revenue generation and economic development.
 
DAI’s sixth consecutive STARR II IDIQ task order award, the LRMA win is testament to close collaboration across the USG Business Unit and DAI’s platform team, which provided vital support on this bid. Thanks and many congratulations to everyone who contributed to the win.
