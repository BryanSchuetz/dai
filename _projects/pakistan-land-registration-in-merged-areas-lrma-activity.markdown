The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Settlement and Land Record project is a major commitment to the people of the province’s Merged Areas of northwestern Pakistan. The commitment is not only in terms of monetary and human resources—it is a commitment to provide the economic, social, and gender equity benefits of secure land tenure and property rights. By so doing, the project is a crucial contribution to overcoming the economic and social development lags of the areas.  

The Land Registration in Merged Areas (LRMA) Activity contributes to the project by establishing a land record and registration system in seven districts of the Merged Areas (formerly the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) so that citizens, families, landowners, investors, banks, and government actors have access to accurate, understandable, and current records of their land rights. 
 
LRMA strengthens the legal framework that supports access to accurate ownership and title records, equitable rights recognition, dispute resolution systems (both formal and informal), collateralization of land, and the private use of government land for revenue generation and economic development.

* Advise the client on deploying innovative information and communications technology and survey technologies. In so doing, however, we will reinforce the use of “fit-for-purpose” technology—technology that balances speed, accuracy, and affordability.
* Engage women and other marginalized groups in the design of activities to promote their rights in land settlement processes.
* Build capacity to implement land settlement and deliver land records management services. 
* Develop specific communication messages around the maintenance of land records to generate public buy-in and ownership.
