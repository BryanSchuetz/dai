 From the burgeoning population centers of Java to the small island communities of Maluku, the Indonesian people face increasing risk from droughts, floods, and landslides. APIK is USAID/Indonesia's first project focusing exclusively on climate change adaptation.

APIK will support the Government of Indonesia to improve climate and disaster resilience, working in an integrated manner from the national level to local communities. APIK will help to integrate climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction into national and subnational governance frameworks, build the capacity of local communities and the private sector to address climate change and weather-related hazards, and support information for climate and disaster risk management.

###  Sample Activities

* Build local leadership and capacity through working groups that address climate and disaster risk in the context of their own development objectives.
* Leverage resources and expertise from local partners who serve as conveners, investors, information aggregators, and thought leaders.
* Tailor climate information tools and services for those on the frontlines of climate adaptation and disaster response, including through the application of open-source, user-centric monitoring technologies introduced by the [DAI Maker Lab.][2]
* Target support to those most susceptible, such as urban slum inhabitants living at the rising water's edge.
