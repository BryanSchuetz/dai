The Ukraine Governance and Local Accountability (HOVERLA) program builds on the accomplishments of USAID’s previous governance support to complete the necessary legal framework for decentralization and mitigate against backsliding, support the operation of newly consolidated communities, improve services delivered to citizens, and advance citizen engagement at all levels.
 
HOVERLA’s key objectives are to ensure that Ukraine's system of local self-governance is increasingly institutionalized and effective, that subnational governments are more self-reliant, and that citizens can play an increasingly influential role in local governance processes.
