Ukraine continues along the path of decentralization, but there is an urgent need to secure the gains of the past six years of reform. In the aftermath of the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine launched a transformative process of administrative and policy reforms under the umbrella of decentralization, resulting in major policy, structural, and fiscal changes. Stakeholders in Ukraine, including the current Zelensky administration, understand that continued consolidation of gains and expansion of the institutions of democratic local governance are critical to raising local living standards and reducing out-migration, achieving more balanced regional economic development, improving accountability, and enhancing citizen confidence. 

These factors collectively promote sustainability and self-reliance at the subnational level and build the country’s resilience in the face of malign Russian influence, including disinformation campaigns and hybrid warfare in the east and Crimea. As a second-generation activity, HOVERLA will leverage the accomplishments of USAID’s previous support to complete the necessary legal framework and mitigate against backsliding, support the operation of new consolidated communities, improve the quality of services delivered to citizens, and advance citizen engagement at all levels.


The Ukraine Governance and Local Accountability (HOVERLA) program builds on the accomplishments of USAID’s previous governance support to complete the necessary legal framework for decentralization and mitigate against backsliding, support the operation of newly consolidated communities, improve services delivered to citizens, and advance citizen engagement at all levels.
 
HOVERLA’s key objectives are to ensure that Ukraine's system of local self-governance is increasingly institutionalized and effective, that subnational governments are more self-reliant, and that citizens can play an increasingly influential role in local governance processes.
