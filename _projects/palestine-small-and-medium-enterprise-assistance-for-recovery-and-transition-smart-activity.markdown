The Palestine Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance for Recovery and Transition (SMART) Activity operates in Gaza as well as the West Bank, offering a combination of immediate financial support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and sustainable systemic strengthening to help Palestinian SMEs rapidly recover from the COVID-19 shock and put them on a path to revitalization—despite the persistent challenges of restricted movement of goods and people, and limited access to export markets—to create job opportunities for a growing, young population.
