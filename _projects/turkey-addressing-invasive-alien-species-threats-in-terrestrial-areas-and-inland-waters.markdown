Invasive alien species are considered one of the main causes for marine and coastal biodiversity loss in Turkey, posing one of the principal threats to coastal development in the country. Besides impacting native species and ecosystems, invasive alien species can have negative economic and social effects, as well as affect public health. 

Identification, eradication, and management of invasive alien species is cited in Turkey’s National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity. However, legislative gaps and lack of coordination among institutions in the country hinder its implementation.
 
The overall goal of this project is to ensure the resilience of inland waters and terrestrial ecosystems in Turkey with a specific focus on invasive alien species. It aims to get the species under control in targeted terrestrial areas and inland waters in line with European Union regulations. 

Our team is supporting Turkey with the preparation of a legal instrument, developing action and management plans as well as building the institutional capacity of relevant authorities and actions to increase public awareness. 

### Sample Activities

* Identify legislative gaps for the control of invasive alien species in terrestrial areas and inland waters.
* Control or eradicate invasive alien species of interest.
* Improve the management capacity of institutional staff.
* Increase public awareness.
