Mozambique has been engaged in economic policy reform since its first democratic elections in 1994. With a pressing need to reform the country’s business policies and strengthen private sector participation, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Support Program for Economic and Enterprise Development (SPEED), a five-year, $19.4 million project implemented by DAI. Over the course of the program, [SPEED successfully expanded policy reforms](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/reforming-business-policy-mozambique/?utm_source=daidotcom) which resulted in increased trade and investment, a stronger competitive position for Mozambican firms, and increased local job opportunities and incomes.

To build upon this momentum, the USAID-funded Supporting the Policy Environment for Economic Development ([SPEED\+](http://www.speed-program.com/)) program works to further develop a favorable business environment to attract investment, expand markets, and reduce costs, thus contributing to broad-based and inclusive economic growth and conservation of natural resources. Working with consortium partners that include Nathan Associates and Mozambican firms CIMPOGEST, IMPACTO, and Sal & Caldeira, DAI is helping to advance reforms in key areas such as agriculture, trade and investment, power, water, and biodiversity conservation, while improving government transparency and fostering new public-private partnerships.
