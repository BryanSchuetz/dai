Mozambique has been engaged in economic policy reform since its first democratic elections in 1994. With a pressing [need to reform](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/mozambique-even-a-progressive-land-law-needs-revision-after-a-generation-of-experience/) the country’s business policies and strengthen private sector participation, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Support Program for Economic and Enterprise Development (SPEED), implemented by DAI from 2010 to 2015. Over the course of the program, [SPEED successfully expanded policy reforms](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/reforming-business-policy-mozambique?utm_source=daidotcom) that increased trade and investment, the competitiveness of Mozambican firms, and local job opportunities and incomes.

To build upon this momentum, the USAID-funded Supporting the Policy Environment for Economic Development ([SPEED\+](http://www.speed-program.com/)) program works to further develop a favorable business environment to attract investment and expand markets, with the goal of contributing to inclusive economic growth and the conservation of natural resources. Working with consortium partner Nathan Associates, DAI is helping to [advance reforms](https://www.dai.com/news/dais-ian-rose-on-legal-reform-in-the-land-sector) in key areas such as agriculture, trade and investment, power, water, and biodiversity conservation, while also improving government transparency and fostering new public-private partnerships.
