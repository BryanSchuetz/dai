The Advancing Capacity for the Environment (ACE) program facilitates the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s work to fight climate change, conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources, improve land governance, and expand access to secure, modern energy and resilient infrastructure. [ACE](https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/advancing-capacity-environment-ace-program-fact-sheet) strengthens capacities for technical leadership and effective programming through integrated support in four areas: communications, knowledge management, training, and organizational development.

The intensity and complexity of today’s environmental challenges—from climate change and ocean plastic pollution to natural resource degradation and biodiversity loss—threaten to reverse decades of progress in global development. To sustain improvements in human welfare, USAID is taking bold action to address these challenges through investments that cut across all technical sectors.

This requires a shift in Agency programming toward greater integration and collaboration, as well as enhanced policy guidance and thought leadership. ACE is designed to meet these needs through technical assistance to USAID’s Washington offices and field Missions to sustain and grow their capacities for communication, learning, and knowledge sharing.

By enhancing USAID's effectiveness, the ACE program contributes to positive, sustainable development outcomes globally with a focus on Agency programs in the environment, energy, and infrastructure sectors.
