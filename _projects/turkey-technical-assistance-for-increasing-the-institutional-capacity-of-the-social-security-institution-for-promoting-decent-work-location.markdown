"Decent Work," a term first used by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 1999, was adopted by the United Nations as one of the Millennium Development Goals. In 2005, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) replaced the Millennium Development Goals, and built on the principle of “leaving no one behind” and aiming to achieve sustainable development for all. Decent Work remains one of the pillars of global development. In particular, [SDG Goal 8 on Decent Work](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg8) promotes inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all—women and men, young people, and persons with disabilities—by 2030.

Decent Work puts people and planet at the center of the development process and corresponds to the aspirations of people in their working lives – aspirations for (1) opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income. It also requires (2) security in the workplace and social protection for families, (3) better prospects for personal development and social integration, (4) freedom for people to express their concerns, organise and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and (5) equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men. The concept of Decent Work is captured in four strategic objectives: Rights at work, employment creation, social protection, and social dialogue.

Technical Assistance for Increasing the Institutional Capacity of the Social Security Institution for Promoting Decent Work Location, led by DAI’s Human Dynamics, improves the legal and institutional framework to enhance work culture in the labor market in Turkey.
