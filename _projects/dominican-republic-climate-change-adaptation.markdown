DAI is developing a feasibility study and final designs for a climate change adaptation programme for the Yaque del Sur River Basin in the Dominican Republic. Intended to promote environmental and social resilience, the programme will be based on an integrated water resource management system and an adaptive social protection mechanism.
 
Funded through Agence Française de Développement’s [Adapt’Action](https://www.afd.fr/en/adaptaction) Framework, the study will inform a shared vision of the objectives of basin management and the actions necessary to manage the basin’s water resources in the face of climate breakdown—in accordance with the requirements of sustainable, economically viable, and socially equitable development.
