In recent years, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI have helped Indonesia—the country that has suffered the most human deaths from H5N1 avian influenza—make great strides in reducing its vulnerability to the virus. The SAFE project was created by USAID/Indonesia's Avian and Pandemic Influenza Program to further reduce the risk and potential impact of the virus on animals and humans. We operate in high-risk districts of Western and Central Java and Greater Jakarta, in close collaboration with government, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, service providers, community groups, and other stakeholders.

###  Sample Activities

* Facilitate public-private partnerships in high-risk districts to improve biosecurity and good farming practices and to transmission of H5N1 among poultry.
* Identify and apply incentives for the private poultry industry to increase biosecurity practices.
* Develop and implement safe farming strategies for commercial farms.
* Improve knowledge about H5N1 among key audiences through strategic communication and community empowerment.
* Increase awareness of the symptoms and risk factors of H5N1-related illness so households can recognize them and respond appropriately.
* Host face-to-face discussions with partner organizations and the Indonesian poultry industry to coordinate efforts.
