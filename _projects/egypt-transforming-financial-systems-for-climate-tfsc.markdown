The Arab Republic of Egypt is highly vulnerable to climate change and faces numerous threats to its economic, social and environmental sustainability. Population increased from 36 million in 1973 to approx. 102 million in mid 2021. The demographic growth coupled with ambitious development and industrialization policies have put a heavy pressure on natural resources in the form of heavy air, water, and soil pollution. The magnitude of these environmental and social costs is likely to offset some of the economic growth gains. However, existing national strategies in Egypt reveal a remarkable awareness of the value of a "Green Transformation" to Egypt's competitiveness and future development prospects.  The ‘Transforming Financial Systems for Climate’ (TFSC) programme has been structured by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD)  together with the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  The AFD Group and the National Bank of Egypt - the oldest commercial bank in Egypt  - form a strategic partnership in order to promote low carbon transition in Egypt and to support the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

The specific objectives of TFSC in Egypt are as the followings:

· Support Egyptian financial institutions in adopting a climate finance strategy and tools;

· Provide support for the promotion of the green sustainable growth in different sectors, leveraging both public and private financing;

· Consolidate the application of market-based instruments for environmental / climate-smart investments;

· Improve the competitiveness and growth of cleaner business opportunities that lead to job creation.
