Reforming public financial management in Malawi is a complex process that requires keen understanding of how change happens within this context—the political economy, key stakeholders and their priorities, and the interrelated and systemic technical bottlenecks. 

Under “Chuma Cha Dziko,” or “National Economy,” DAI works with the Government of Malawi, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning, and Development, and other stakeholders to achieve efficient and effective use of public resources and support the growth of the economy and development of Malawi.

In the wake of the 2014 corruption scandal known as “[Cashgate](https://www.economist.com/baobab/2014/02/27/the-32m-heist),” Chuma Cha Dziko has been designed to reform public financial management in Malawi. Strengthening government systems and capabilities in public finance, internal control and public procurement, and a coherent effective tax policy regime are critical in supporting the government to improve public investments and services. Changing behaviours and established norms is an important part of this initiative.

Since 2014, the Government of Malawi has continuously reiterated its commitment to develop a strong public finance system and demonstrate accountability to its electorate, and the European Union (EU) is supporting its partner country to improve the management of public finances. With EU budget support to Malawi suspended since the scandal, the EU and the Malawian Government have agreed a roadmap back to budget support. Chuma Cha Dziko will significantly contribute to Malawi’s ability to respond the requirements set out in the roadmap.
