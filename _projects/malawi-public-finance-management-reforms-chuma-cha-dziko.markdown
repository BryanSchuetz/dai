Public Financial Management (PFM) Reform in Malawi is a complex process, that requires keen understanding of how change happens within this context - the political economy at play, key stakeholders and their priorities and the interrelated and systemic technical bottlenecks. 
Under “Chuma Cha Dziko”, DAI works with the Government of Malawi (GoM), the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development (MoFEPD), and other key stakeholders to contribute to their goal in achieving efficient and effective use of public resources and support the growth of the economy and development of Malawi.
In the wake of the 2014 corruption scandal known as the  «Cash-gate Scandal», Chuma Cha Dziko has been designed to effectively contribute to Public Financial Management Reforms that are at the centre of Malawi’s reform agenda. Strengthening government systems and capabilities in PFM, internal control and public procurement, and a coherent effective tax policy regime will be critical in supporting the government to improve public investments and services. Changing behaviours and established norms is an important part of this.
Since 2014, the Government of Malawi has continuously reiterated its commitment to develop a strong PFM system and demonstrate accountability to its electorate, and the European Union is supporting its partner country to improve the management of public finances. With EU budget support to Malawi suspended since the Cash-gate scandal, the EU and the Malawian Government have agreed a roadmap back to budget support. The “Chuma Cha Dziko” project will significantly contribute to Malawi’s ability to respond the requirements set out in the Roadmap.
