As the humanitarian disaster in Gaza continues to ravage communities, resulting in a horrific death toll, mass displacement, and destruction of infrastructure, Palestinians in the West Bank also are suffering significant hardships due to the war. The combination of destroyed infrastructure resulting from Israeli incursions, new and irregular checkpoints, and settler violence have had an impact on all aspects of life. Citizens across the West Bank are increasingly vulnerable as disruptions to basic services (such as water, sanitation, and electricity), high unemployment, and economic impacts persist. These hardships and the upsurge in citizen needs are concentrated at the municipal level—the most dynamic, effective, and visible level of governance for Palestinian citizens. In these circumstances, local government units (LGUs) across the West Bank are doing their best to respond. 
The USAID West Bank/Gaza Accountable Local Governance Activity (ALG) will support LGUs to respond to immediate needs while strengthening the foundation for resilient longer-term service delivery improvements and citizen accountability. ALG builds on previous USAID local government and service delivery programs, while complementing ongoing activities focused on water, youth, civil society, private sector engagement (PSE), and 
construction.




We are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded the Accountable Local Governance (ALG) Activity, a USAID initiative to improve the delivery of essential public services and promote inclusive and accountable governance in the West Bank and Gaza.
 
A task order under the Active Communities Effective States indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity umbrella contract, ALG will enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of municipalities and village councils in service delivery and citizen engagement, with a focus on under-represented and marginalized groups; strengthen municipal fiscal management; and build resilience to shocks and stressors, such as conflict.
 
ALG will focus on two tracks: 1) the immediate recovery of municipal services and operations from the effects of the current war, and 2) medium- to long-term development. Meeting citizen needs by supporting improvements in municipal services and accountability at the local level will ensure that local governments continue to act as a stabilizing force, despite difficult and uncertain conditions across the Palestinian Territories.
 
The ALG Activity represents a significant addition to our portfolio in governance and public service delivery, and is a welcome opportunity to continue DAI’s long record of engagement in the West Bank and Gaza. Many thanks and congratulations to the team behind this important award.
