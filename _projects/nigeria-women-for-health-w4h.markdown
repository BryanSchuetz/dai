When the Women for Health (W4H) programme began in 2012, women faced a one in nine lifetime risk of maternal death; 19.5 percent and 12.3 percent of deliveries in the North East and North West were attended by a skilled provider, compared to 82 percent in the southeast and southwest. Rural deliveries in the northern part of the country were three times less likely than those in urban areas to be attended by a skilled provider. 

The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) is tackling this problem by empowering women as service providers in six states in northern Nigeria through its [Women for Health (W4H)](http://www.women4healthnigeria.org/) programme.

Since November 2012, W4H has increased the number and capacity of female health workers in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara, while at the same time contributed to women’s empowerment and gender equality in communities and institutions in the northern region.

This responds to a severe shortage of female health workers in a region where there are social and cultural barriers to women being seen by male health workers.

It is expected that the increased numbers of female health workers will lead to an improvement in women’s access to and use of health services in northern Nigeria and improve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). 

Working closely with, W4H has expanded operations into Borno State as part of the new phase of the program (April 2018-2020).

W4H works closely with other existing health and education programs in the states to use a “building back better” approach in the conflict- and humanitarian emergency- affected areas in Borno and Yobe states, and ensure sustainability of the progress achieved over the last five years in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, and Zamfara.

A national team, led by [Dr. Fatima Adamu](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/fatima-adamu), provides technical support to state-level teams, backed by a senior technical advisory group.

The Women for Health programme is funded with UK aid from the UK Government. The programme is led by DAI Global Health (incorporating  Health Partners International and GRID), in partnership with Save the Children.
