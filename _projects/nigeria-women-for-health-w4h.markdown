Nigeria has the [highest number of maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://devex.shorthandstories.com/care-amid-conflict/index.html) and high rates of under-5 child mortality. These indicators are even more severe in northern Nigeria, where up to 90 percent of pregnant women deliver their babies without a skilled birth attendant. States such as Yobe and Borno are particularly fragile, suffering insurgency which has terrorised young women. Female health workers are particularly important in the north of the country because social norms in rural communities can prohibit women from receiving care from male health workers.
The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) is tackling this problem by training women to be service providers in six states in northern Nigeria through its [Women for Health (W4H) programme](http://www.women4healthnigeria.org/). 

Since November 2012, W4H has increased the number and capacity of female health workers in Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara, while at the same time supporting women’s empowerment, promoting gender equality, and tackling trauma. It has improved women’s access to and use of health services in northern Nigeria while advancing Nigeria’s journey toward universal health coverage. W4H works closely with other health and education programs in the states, taking a “building back better” approach in conflict and humanitarian emergency-affected areas of Borno and Yobe states while ensuring the sustainability of progress in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, and Zamfara.
A national team, led by [Dr. Fatima Adamu](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/fatima-adamu), provides technical support to state-level teams, backed by a senior technical advisory group. The programme is led by DAI Global Health in partnership with Save the Children. W4H works closely with 22 midwifery, nursing, and community health extension worker training institutions and state ministries of health to support the training of female health workers and their deployment to rural health facilities.
