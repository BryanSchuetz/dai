The Advancing Women for Resilient Agricultural Supply Chains (AWRAS) project works to expand women’s equality of access to—and control over—resources, opportunities, and decision-making authority in sustainable agricultural supply chains worldwide.
 
With a planned collective investment of $50 million to start, AWRAS will strengthen agricultural production, enhance livelihoods, and improve environmental stewardship by increasing support for women farmers. Managed by DAI, the partnership between PepsiCo, Unilever, Danone, McCormick & Company, Nespresso, and USAID will establish and implement gender-responsive initiatives that mitigate supply chain risks and strengthen environmental sustainability outcomes, with the long-term aim of incentivizing more private sector actors—and influencing policy—to systematically promote gender-responsive supply chains. We ultimately aim to leverage up to $60 million in private sector funding.
 
A true “One DAI” effort, AWRAS brings together DAI’s USG and SBG business units, who will collaborate to deliver across a USAID-funded cooperative agreement and five private sector contracts. The project evolved out of a contract with PepsiCo managed by SBG; the partnership is the result of a rapid co-creation with USAID and the private sector firms, facilitated by DAI over the summer of 2024. Led by Chief of Party Rhiannon Gulick, AWRAS will build on USG’s USAID program management capabilities, drawing on gender and agriculture expertise from the Economic Growth sector, as well as SBG’s technical capacity and private sector networks.
 
AWRAS was launched on the Clinton Global Initiative mainstage during this fall’s NYC Climate Week as part of the U.S. Government’s Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE) Initiative. The USAID/Integrated Natural Resource Management activity supports USAID in the operationalization of WISE.
