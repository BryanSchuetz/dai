The Advancing Women for Resilient Agricultural Supply Chains (AWRAS) project works to expand women’s equality of access to—and control over—resources, opportunities, and decision-making authority in sustainable agricultural supply chains worldwide.
 
AWRAS strengthens agricultural production, enhances livelihoods, and improves environmental stewardship by increasing support for women farmers. Managed by DAI, the partnership between PepsiCo, Unilever, Danone, McCormick & Company, Nespresso, and USAID establishes and implements gender-responsive initiatives that mitigate supply chain risks and strengthen environmental sustainability outcomes, with the long-term aim of incentivizing more private sector actors—and influencing policy—to systematically promote gender-responsive supply chains.
