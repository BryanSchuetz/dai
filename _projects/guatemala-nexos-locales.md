To achieve this goal, the project works at the intersection—or nexos—of good governance.

The team will work with the municipalities to improve basic services delivery and security plans, as well as [increase civil society participation](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/mitigating-instability-in-central-america/?utm_source=daidotcom) in decision-making.

Nexos Locales will also increase the capacity of the National Association of Municipalities and the Guatemalan Association of Indigenous Mayors and Authorities to support municipal development and replicate successful models nationwide, including municipal [crime prevention](https://medium.com/usaid-2030/providing-hope-for-a-violence-free-future-609ead1771ad) plans.
