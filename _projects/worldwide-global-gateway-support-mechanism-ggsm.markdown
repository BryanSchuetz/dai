The world still faces a massive gap in financing for investment in new and existing infrastructure, and available resources could be used in a more effective way. In this context, the European Union’s (EU) Global Gateway initiative invests in the digitalisation, health, climate, energy, and transport sectors, as well as in education and research. Within the overarching framework of the initiative, our work focuses on the transport sector by supporting actors managing or implementing EU cooperation programmes at the global, regional, and country levels to assess, design, monitor, and evaluate connectivity and quality infrastructure interventions.

This project is to facilitate that European Union (EU) policy on quality transport infrastructure and connectivity is adequately embedded by partner countries and other stakeholders.  

In close coordination with the contracting authority and EU Delegations, the project will swiftly design, develop and implement technical assistance packages as per the request of beneficiary countries and regions.  A large range of partner countries can benefit from this action. The countries include those covered by the Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument - Global Europe (NDICI/Global Europe), mainly focusing on a limited number of African corridors, where the EU financing can make a difference in terms of impact.
Therefore, the required expertise and response will vary across the countries and according to the proposed projects. Technical assistance will be provided subject to the willingness and the readiness of the country to demonstrate the necessary political commitment to undertake appropriate reforms and investments.
