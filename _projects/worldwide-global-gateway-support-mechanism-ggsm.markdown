The Knowledge Hub Jobs & Growth (Part I)—Global Gateway Support Mechanism (GGSM) project. The Global Gateway initiative is the European Union (EU)’s plan for investing in infrastructure development around the world. The GGSM will focus primarily on the transport sector by supporting actors managing or implementing EU cooperation programmes—in particular EU Delegations, EU Headquarters, and partner countries—to assess, design, monitor, and evaluate investments in connectivity and infrastructure at global, regional, and country levels.
 
Our technical expertise will be organised in four areas: supporting countries to establish connectivity strategies and policies; building the institutional capacity of relevant actors in the policy and regulatory arena, with a particular emphasis on promoting the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure in the transport sector; providing technical support in programming and preparing projects; and operationalizing the EU connectivity strategy.
 
The assisted projects will foster the sustainable development of partner countries by reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and diversifying supply chains. Our assistance will be responsive to the requests of beneficiary countries and regions, and closely coordinated with the Directorate-General for International Partnerships and with the EU Delegations in their respective countries. GGSM is designed to support a wide range of partner countries but will likely focus mainly on African corridors where EU financing can have the most substantial impact.
