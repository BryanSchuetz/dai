Uzbekistan AVC is capitalizing on the achievements of USAID's Uzbekistan AgLinks (2007–2011) and [AgLinks Plus](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-aglinks-plus) (2011–2015) projects, which were implemented by DAI. We are scaling up support to post-harvest handling and fostering new business partnerships while expanding opportunities for women's entrepreneurship and employment. Uzbekistan AVC is co-investing with stakeholders at key points along the chain—including local institutes, agrarian universities, and service providers such as agro-input dealers, nursery extension staff, pruning groups, consolidators, and [cold chain operators](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/the-proliferation-of-cold-storage-in-uzbekistan/)—to ensure scalability and sustainability.

We aim to [improve the quality](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/the-proliferation-of-cold-storage-in-uzbekistan/) and volume of agricultural production and post-harvest handling and production, facilitate market linkages, and link educational institutions with private sector demand.

###  Sample Activities

* Provide technical assistance in best agricultural practices at demo plots for crops such as cherry, peach, apple, grape, pomegranate, tomato, cucumber, onion, and carrot.
* Invest in the full operation of Uzbekistan's new tissue culture lab and supplemental support to government institutions to propagate disease-free, true-to-type plant materials locally and distribute them to certified nursery operators.
* Use the MEVA 3.0 platform to develop a social marketing forum to allow users to access up-to-date information on quantities, qualities, and pricing for horticulture to drive marketing decisions for farmers, cold store owners and managers, exporters, and buyers.
* Facilitate cold chain demo site activities, workshops targeted to women, and exchange programs for cold storage operators.
* Build linkages between producers and local supermarkets, take advantage of local trade events, and develop relationships with buyers in new markets.
* Conduct AVC horticulture assessment and mapping with agrarian university professors and students, and develop hands-on production and post-harvest learning at universities.
* [Introduce new ICT tools](https://dai-global-digital.com/horticulturalist-chat-groups-and-youtube-q-and-as-an-uzbek-ict4ag-case-study.html?utm_source=daidotcom) to help facilitate learning.
