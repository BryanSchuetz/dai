Uzbekistan AVC will capitalize on the achievements of USAID's Uzbekistan AgLinks (2007–2011) and AgLinks Plus (2011–2015) projects, which were implemented by DAI. We will scale up support to postharvest handling and foster new business partnerships while expanding opportunities for women's entrepreneurship and employment. Uzbekistan AVC will co-invest with stakeholders at key points along the chain—including local institutes, agrarian universities, and service providers such as agro-input dealers, nursery extension staff, pruning groups, consolidators, and cold chain operators—to ensure scalability and sustainability.

Our objectives are to improve the quality and volume of agricultural production and post-harvest handling and production, facilitate market linkages, and link educational institutions with private sector demand.

###  Sample Activities

* Provide technical assistance in best agricultural practices at demo plots for crops such as cherry, peach, apple, grape, pomegranate, tomato, cucumber, onion, and carrot.
* Invest in the full operation of Uzbekistan's new tissue culture lab and supplemental support to government institutions to propagate disease-free, true-to-type plant materials locally and distribute them to certified nursery operators.
* Use the MEVA 3.0 platform to develop a social marketing forum to allow users to access up-to-date information on quantities, qualities, and pricing for horticulture to drive marketing decisions for farmers, cold store owners and managers, exporters, and buyers.
* Facilitate cold chain demo site activities, workshops targeted to women, and exchange programs for cold storage operators.
* Build linkages between producers and local supermarkets, take advantage of local trade events, and develop relationships with buyers in new markets.
* Conduct AVC horticulture assessment and mapping with agrarian university professors and students, and develop hands-on production and post-harvest learning at universities.
