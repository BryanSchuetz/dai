The Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP) aims to save lives and reduce the impact of disease outbreaks and epidemics. 

Delivered by World Health Organisation Africa Regional Office (WHO/AFRO), DAI and a third-party monitoring supplier, TDDAP will strengthen health systems and institutions to deliver better health security and improve disease preparedness and response and accelerate Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

The four-year TDDAP project is a segment of the broader programme, and focuses on Cameroon, Chad, Côte D’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Uganda. The TDDAP project will strengthen country leadership and accountability for population health by:

* addressing fragmentation in global health security and universal health coverage;
* addressing inadequate surveillance, evidence-based decision making and cross-border coordination; and
* improving the poor communications that contributes local outbreaks becoming international epidemics.

The TDDAP Project will support country leadership and accountability for integrated health security planning using infectious diseases as an entry point for strengthening International Health Regulation compliance. The project also supports an Emergency Response Mechanism for strengthening capacity to manage preparedness and response to pre-crisis situations at the sub-national level across sub-Saharan Africa.

Core partners include ICI-Santé, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Fondation Mérieux, Operations Partnership and UK-Med in addition to resource partners, Institute of Development Studies, EHealth Nigeria, and [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) affiliate IntraHealth.

### Select Activities

* Engage in strengthening in-country networks of government and civil society with respect to International Health Regulation (IHR) compliance, infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response. 
* Use WHO tools such as Joint External Evaluations and tabletop simulations that DAI helped develop and pilot, with country coordinators adapting approaches to local circumstances.
* Utilize information management and transparency at national and subnational levels to inform decision makers, prioritise prevention actions, and activate emergency and other responses.
* Create a monitoring and evaluation framework that captures cause-and-effect relationships among inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact.
* Capture Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI)/disability sensitive information, such as the number of facilities where GESI data has been collected.
* Develop emergency response mechanisms with strong capacity in community engagement and behaviour change communication.
* Build on digital platforms such as IntraHealth’s [mHero technology](https://www.mhero.org/about) to connect data from existing health information systems to allow for real-time communication during crises.
* Provide U.K. Department for International Development  with prompt, evidence-based information upon which to make resource allocation decisions, with flexible standby teams of emergency response specialists mobilizing in-country in the event of a pre-crisis outbreak.
* Access pre-approved suppliers to mobilise quickly where needed; DAI disaster response services have included direct grant financing of local organisations.
