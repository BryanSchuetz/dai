The Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP) aims to save lives and reduce the impact of disease outbreaks and epidemics.

Delivered by World Health Organisation Africa Regional Office (WHO/AFRO), DAI, and a third-party monitoring supplier, TDDAP will strengthen health systems and institutions to deliver better health security, improve disease preparedness and response, and accelerate Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

The four-year TDDAP project is a segment of the broader programme, and focuses on Cameroon, Chad, Côte D’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, and Uganda. The TDDAP project will strengthen country leadership and accountability for population health by:

* Addressing fragmentation in global health security and universal health coverage.

* Addressing inadequate surveillance, evidence-based decision making, and cross-border coordination.

* Improving poor communications that contribute to local outbreaks becoming international epidemics.

The TDDAP Project will support country leadership and accountability for integrated health security planning using infectious diseases as an entry point for strengthening International Health Regulation compliance. The project also supports an Emergency Response Mechanism for strengthening capacity to manage preparedness and response to pre-crisis situations at the sub-national level across sub-Saharan Africa.

Core partners include ICI-Santé, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Fondation Mérieux, The Operations Partnership, and UK-Med, in addition to resource partners Institute of Development Studies, EHealth Nigeria, and [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) affiliate IntraHealth.

### Sample Activities

* Engage in strengthening in-country networks of government and civil society with respect to International Health Regulation compliance, infectious disease surveillance, and outbreak response.

* Employ WHO tools such as Joint External Evaluations and One Health tabletop simulations, that DAI helped develop and pilot, in setting priorities for National Action Plans for health security linked to UHC.

* Strengthen information management and evidence uptake mechanisms at national and subnational levels to enable  decision makers to prioritise prevention actions and activate emergency and other responses.

* Co-create a monitoring and evaluation framework that captures relationships among inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impact in using health security investment to improve UHC.

* Capture Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI)/disability sensitive information, such as the number of facilities where GESI data has been collected.

* Develop emergency response mechanisms that fill a critical gap at the sub-national level related to community engagement for preparedness and response.

* Build on digital platforms such as IntraHealth’s [mHero technology](https://www.mhero.org/about) to connect data from existing health information systems to allow for real-time communication during crises.

* Provide global stakeholders, such as the U.K. Department for International Development, with prompt, evidence-based information to support resource allocation decisions, with flexible standby teams of emergency response specialists mobilizing in-country in the event of a pre-crisis outbreak.

* Access pre-approved suppliers to mobilise quickly where needed.
