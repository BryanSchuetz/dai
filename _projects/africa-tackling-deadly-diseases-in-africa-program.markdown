The Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Program (TDDAP) aims to save lives and reduce the impact of disease outbreaks and epidemics. The five-year TDDAP project addresses:

* Poor disease surveillance and communication from remote locations to national authorities;
* Weak public health services and infrastructure;
* Rumours and poor information affecting behaviours that then spread disease;
* Poorly equipped—though dedicated—doctors, nurses and public health staff;
* Poor cross-border coordination that leads to the spread of disease to large cities; and
* Weak national government presence and fragile economic conditions in outbreak areas.

TDDAP will strengthen health systems and institutions, including the World Health Organisation Africa Regional Office (WHO AFRO), to deliver better health security, improve disease preparedness and response in six countries (Cameroon, Uganda, Côte D’Ivoire, Niger, Mali, Chad), and provide an emergency response contingency mechanism should a pre-crisis situation arise across sub-Saharan Africa.

Core partners include ICI-Santé, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Fondation Mérieux, Operations Partnership and UK-Med in addition to resource partners, Institute of Development Studies, EHealth Nigeria, and [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) affiliate IntraHealth.

### Select Activities

* Leverage in-country networks in government and civil society and those experienced with infectious disease surveillance and outbreak response. 
* Use WHO tools such as Joint External Evaluations and tabletop simulations that DAI helped develop and pilot, with country coordinators adapting approaches to local circumstances.
* Utilize information management and transparency at national and subnational levels to inform decision makers, prioritise prevention actions, and activate emergency and other responses.
* Create a monitoring and evaluation framework that captures cause-and-effect relationships among inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact.
* Capture Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI)/disability sensitive information, such as the number of facilities where GESI data has been collected.
* Develop emergency response mechanisms with strong capacity in community engagement and behaviour change communication.
* Build on digital platforms such as IntraHealth’s [mHero technology](https://www.mhero.org/about) to connect data from existing health information systems to allow for real-time communication during crises.
* Provide U.K. Department for International Development  with prompt, evidence-based information upon which to make resource allocation decisions, with flexible standby teams of emergency response specialists mobilizing in-country in the event of a pre-crisis outbreak.
* Access pre-approved suppliers to mobilise quickly where needed; DAI disaster response services have included direct grant financing of local organisations.
