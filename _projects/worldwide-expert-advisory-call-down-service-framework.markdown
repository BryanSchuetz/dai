Health Partners International, a DAI Global Health firm, is a subcontractor for the Expert Advisory Call Down Service (EACDS) Framework Contracts, global lots B and C. 

### Lot B
Lot B covers programming in strengthening resilience and response to crises. This includes mitigating ongoing crises, global public health risks, and support for efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and build resilience of poor people and countries to other disaster or conflict risks. Expertise requirements include design, delivery, and monitoring of all risk-informed development investments across key sectors that build resilience; humanitarian sector disaster risk reduction; and informing and developing responses to the changing nature of systems and society.

### Lot C
The scope of work under Lot C covers promoting global prosperity, prioritising approaches to improving the business climate, competitiveness and operation of markets, energy and financial sector reform, and increasing the ability of governments to tackle corruption. The aim is to drive higher sustained inclusive growth and encourage longer term economic transformation in pursuit of the first Global Goal—eradicating poverty everywhere. This requires expertise in applied economics, trade and foreign direct investment, private sector development instruments and approaches, inclusive growth and harnessing the private sector, infrastructure for growth and prosperity, and agriculture.
