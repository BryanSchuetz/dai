Following Mongolia’s transition from a state managed to market economy, migration to the nation’s capital, Ulaanbaatar, led to a rapid and uncontrolled expansion of the city’s outer suburbs. Sprawling settlements continue to develop without planned infrastructure, resulting in limited and expensive water and sanitation services. Unclear governing responsibilities have further hindered the installation of public water systems in these areas, contributing to increased health and environmental risks for people living there.

In support of the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC) Second Compact with Mongolia, DAI is developing policy and planning solutions to address constraints to water access and supply in Ulaanbaatar’s periphery settlements. DAI’s team advises the MCC on how to strengthen the ability of local institutions to manage urban expansion and plan for future water needs. The team also investigates policy recommendations to improve urban water services.

### Sample Activities

* Conduct a foundational analysis of existing public and private water and sanitation services in suburban settlements.

* Provide comparative analysis of cities that have undergone similar urban transformation in water and land use to determine replicable solutions.

* Conduct due diligence recommendations for potential MCC investments and interventions.

* Utilize innovative technology, such as mobile forms, SMS surveys, or digital water point mapping, to capture data on water access and needs.
