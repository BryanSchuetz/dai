JCP activities align with the goals and opportunities of the Jordan Compact, which coordinates donor responses to the Syrian Refugee Crisis. The program’s three complementary work streams:

* **Investment**, including through a partnership with the Jordan Investment Commission that aims to strengthen the capacity of its Investment Promotion Department and identify and facilitate specific investment opportunities worth at least $75 million. 
* **Export**, including by providing firm-level assistance to at least 40 Jordanian manufacturers with the capacity and interest to export to the European Union under a Simplified Rules of Origin arrangement.
* **Business Enabling Environment**, including enabling Jordan’s accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty to register and protect patents and encourage innovation and development of home-grown intellectual property.

In 2016, DAI was hired to lead the Project Management Unit of the Jordan Compact, which aims to help create jobs for Jordanians and Syrians by developing exports to the European Union. This Compact between countries is supporting Jordan to mitigate the impact of hosting more than 700,000 registered Syrian refugees. The Compact aims to deliver a measure of stability by leveraging donor and technical assistance to support the Jordanian private sector in industries such as garment manufacture, plastics, and agriculture.

###  Sample Activities

* Position Jordanian clusters within global value chains.
* Create jobs for young people and women, in and outside of Amman.
* Lead the Project Management Unit of the Jordan Compact—see above.

###  Select Results

* Streamlined process for participating in the Jordan-EU Trade Agreement, which designated 18 development zones throughout the country to participate in the trade-facilitation program.

* Published Arabic version of a comprehensive Export Guide aimed at Jordanian small- and medium-sized enterprises to encourage Jordanian exports to the European Union. 

* Developed profiles of African markets—Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania—to enhance new trade around the trade barriers resulting from regional conflicts.

* Launched Jordanian Medical Tourism Initiative to boost Jordan’s competitiveness in the sector and increase investment and export opportunities—with an eye to creating jobs.

* Launched National Home Care Initiative with the King Hussein Cancer Center to advance the home care services industry and create an expected 1,800 jobs beyond the life of JCP.

* Streamlined the Drug Registration Process to greatly reduce the time for private-sector pharmaceutical manufacturers to have a new drug approved for sale; each new drug creates 16 jobs and $1 million in sales revenue.
