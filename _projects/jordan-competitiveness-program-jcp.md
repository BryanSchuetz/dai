Jordan faces an immediate challenge: to create high-quality jobs through increased private sector competitiveness. To do this, the country must look outward for opportunity—through exports and foreign direct investment—while meeting diverse internal needs related to resource scarcity, geographic inequality, and high unemployment among youth and women.

[The Jordan Competitiveness Program (JCP)][1], funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), assists Jordanian private and public sector leaders to achieve competitiveness and job creation goals, equitably and sustainably.

JCP helps to ensure that job creation is based on real growth drivers responding to market demand and capitalizing on existing factors. These drivers include industry specialization in information and communications technology, ramping up capacity in renewable energy, and improving standards for low-cost, high-quality medical services.

###  Sample Activities

* Position Jordanian clusters within global value chains.
* Create jobs for young people and women, in and outside of Amman.

###  Select Results

* Facilitated adoption of four key policies and regulations and four reforms, including Investment Window regulation, which will make it easier for Jordan to attract foreign capital.
* Shortened the period required for the registration of Jordanian manufactured drugs at the Jordan FDA, clearing its registration backlog of 281 drugs, and shortening drug time to market.
* Institutionalized Career Guidance Offices at Jordanian Universities, a first for these institutions and a key step toward bridging students' journey between education and employment.
* Established a Green Economy Unit at the Ministry of Environment, a vibrant learning and knowledge-sharing platform for the emerging leaders of Jordan's green economy.
* Secured direct engagement in Jordan by some of the world's leading tech firms, including Microsoft and Intel, to train, mentor, and boost the competitiveness of the ICT workforce.
* Negotiated five public-private deals, with a total of $6.3 million in funds leveraged from $1.7 million in U.S. Government funds.
