The Expanding Social Protection Programme Phase II (ESP II) delivers unconditional monthly cash transfers to people 80 and older across Uganda. With funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), IrishAid, and Government of Uganda, as of 2019, ESP II was delivering senior citizen grants in 61 districts of Uganda. In November 2018, Parliament and Cabinet committed to a national rollout of the grants in all 135 districts of Uganda by 2021.
 
Under ESP II, DAI manages a Fund Management Team, hosted by the ESP Programme Management Unit of the Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development. DAI manages donor partner funds and provides technical and capacity development assistance to the Government of Uganda to enable effective implementation of the programme nationally. DAI is also tasked with catalysing the formation of a coherent and comprehensive social protection system in Uganda beyond the grant programme.

Nine years after the first pilot payment, ESP has officially reached all eligible beneficiaries in Uganda’s 135 districts. With the donor and DAI’s support, 379,801 people—218,205 women and 161,596 men—now receive their entitlement of UGX 25,000 every month.
