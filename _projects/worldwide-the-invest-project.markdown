INVEST is a flexible, efficient buy-in mechanism that helps the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operating units mobilize private capital. Increasingly, private investors and businesses are looking to emerging markets for better returns and new market opportunities. This represents an opportunity for USAID, but it requires [new forms of collaboration](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets/) with the private sector.

Through the large and growing INVEST partner network, USAID can access the localized expertise it needs, including support for assessments, structuring funds, and providing transaction advisory services. 

INVEST was designed to address challenges that make it harder for USAID to work alongside the investment community. It ensures rapid procurement—within four to six weeks—so USAID can act within investors’ timelines. It enables flexible, specialized project design and implementation. And, it focuses on learning and adaptation to drive innovation in mobilizing private capital. 

Based in Washington, D.C., the INVEST project includes subcontractors CrossBoundary, Tideline, and Convergence, as well as a [growing network](https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-can-blended-finance-close-the-generational-gap-of-aid-workers-91466) of 150 partners.

### Sample Activities

* **Assessments and pipeline development.** For example, INVEST completed a rapid assessment of Gender Lens Investing opportunities in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa, identifying 25 opportunities and recommendations for [USAID’s GenDev programming](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment).
* **Design and structuring support (such as for funds and risk-mitigation instruments).** For example, INVEST conducted a market assessment and designed a blended finance funding platform for USAID/India to mobilize resources and invest in the tuberculosis, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), environmental, energy, and health sectors.
* **Transaction advisory services.** For example, INVEST mobilized advisors to conduct rapid assessments of sectors to encourage investment in Afghanistan, with a focus on deal-making for investment and trade partnerships between Afghanistan and India.
