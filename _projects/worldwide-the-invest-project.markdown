INVEST is a flexible, [efficient](https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-5-hacks-for-a-better-request-for-proposals-process-94249) buy-in mechanism that helps the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operating units mobilize private capital. Increasingly, private investors and businesses are looking to emerging markets for better returns and new market opportunities. This represents an opportunity for USAID, but it requires [new forms of collaboration](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets/) with the private sector.

Through the large and growing INVEST partner network, USAID can access the localized expertise it needs, including support for assessments, structuring funds, and providing transaction advisory services. 

INVEST was designed to address challenges that make it harder for USAID to work alongside the investment community. It ensures rapid procurement—within four to six weeks—so USAID can act within investors’ timelines. It enables flexible, specialized project design and implementation. And, it focuses on learning and adaptation to drive innovation in [mobilizing private capital](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/demand-for-private-capital-draws-usaid-units-to-invest-program/). 

Based in Washington, D.C., the INVEST project includes subcontractors CrossBoundary, Tideline, and Convergence, as well as a [growing network](https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-can-blended-finance-close-the-generational-gap-of-aid-workers-91466) of 150 partners.
