INVEST is a flexible, efficient buy-in mechanism that helps the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operating units mobilize private capital. Through INVEST, USAID accesses the expertise it needs to evaluate and execute [blended finance](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets/) approaches. This supports USAID’s focus on enterprise-led development, unlocking the potential of the private sector to move countries beyond the need for assistance.

INVEST was designed to directly address operational challenges that usually inhibit USAID from working alongside the investment community. It ensures rapid procurement—within four to six weeks—so USAID can act within investors’ short timelines. It enables flexible, specialized project design and implementation. It provides access to partners with localized expertise in investment and development. And, it focuses on learning and adaptation to drive innovation in blended finance.

Based in Washington, D.C., the INVEST project includes DAI subcontractors CrossBoundary, Tideline, and Convergence, as well as a [growing network](https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-can-blended-finance-close-the-generational-gap-of-aid-workers-91466) of more than 130 partners.

### Sample Activities

* **Assessments and pipeline development.** For example, INVEST completed a rapid assessment of Gender Lens Investing opportunities in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa, identifying 25 opportunities and recommendations for [USAID’s GenDev programming](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment).
* **Design and structuring support (such as for funds and risk-mitigation instruments).** For example, INVEST conducted a market assessment and designed a blended finance funding platform for USAID/India to mobilize resources and invest in the tuberculosis, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), environmental, energy, and health sectors.
* **Transaction advisory services.** For example, INVEST mobilized advisors to conduct rapid assessments of sectors to encourage investment in Afghanistan, with a focus on deal-making for investment and trade partnerships between Afghanistan and India.
