DAO Progress aims to assist civil and military authorities in the design and conduct of the security sector reform process (defence component) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly in terms of administration and management, strengthening governance and rule of law, fighting against impunity, and promoting lasting peace.

Specifically, DAO Progress will assist in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of the Army Reform Plan, including the modernisation of the institutional, legal, and regulatory processes. The second component of the project will carry forward the European Union Security Sector Reform Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, expanding on activities that were supported by the mission by modernising the administration and optimising its resources, including by improving HR policies and procedures. Finally, the program will also aim to strengthen the governance of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Command structures including internal and external accountability mechanisms and transparency of budgetary procedures.
