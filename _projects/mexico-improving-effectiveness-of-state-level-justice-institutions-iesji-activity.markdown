The Improving Effectiveness of State-Level Justice Institutions in Mexico (IESJI) Activity consolidates and sustains recent justice system reforms by supporting state-level attorneys general offices and justice courts, with an emphasis on promoting collaboration and durable partnerships between these entities and other justice sector and local actors. These mutually supportive partnerships will enhance Mexico’s capacity to prosecute high-priority crimes—including high-impact and serious crimes—and reduce impunity.
 
Alongside our subcontractors Fortis Consultores, Rapid Results Institute, and Metropolitan Group, DAI is ensuring that IESJI works with engaged, committed local partners, adapting our assistance to their particular needs as those needs change over time. In consultation with these state-level justice actors and community stakeholders, we will define project interventions that are responsive to their level of capacity and in line with their political will so that IESJI’s activities are more likely to be viable, locally owned, and sustainable. And we will help local actors develop their criminal prosecution priorities and strategies—using proven participatory frameworks—so that the justice system is addressing those crimes most relevant to citizens and most directly targeting criminal organizations.
