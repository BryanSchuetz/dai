Loans to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for only 6 percent of the total loan portfolio of Egyptian banks, well below the 10 to 30 percent documented in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Government of Egypt and Central Bank of Egypt have made access to finance for MSMEs a top priority and key area for banking sector reform.

The National Bank of Egypt is the oldest and largest commercial bank in Egypt wholly owned by the Egyptian government. With a nationwide network of more than 300 banking units and dedicated small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) department with nearly 1,000 employees, the bank is a national leader in SME finance. DAI is assisting the bank to increase its microfinance and broader MSME portfolio.
