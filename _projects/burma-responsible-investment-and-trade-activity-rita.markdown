Since Myanmar opened its borders in 2011, economic reform and foreign investment have gradually aligned Myanmar’s political economy with international institutions, investors, and trading partners—these stronger linkages to international markets make it more difficult for the government to ignore calls for reform. Despite these gains, Myanmar’s private sector is still underdeveloped, while the benefits from Myanmar’s annual growth rate of 6-8 percent over the past decade have accrued mainly to the majority Burman community, to businesses located in and around Yangon and Mandalay, to people connected to the armed forces, and to those with access to land and concessions. Gaps in infrastructure, social services, and energy access leave marginalized states at a particular disadvantage.
 
In response to these challenges, the Burma Responsible Investment and Trade Activity (RITA) increases responsible trade and private sector investment by improving corporate governance, business transparency, and competitiveness in Myanmar. RITA engages international and domestic private sector firms and civil society actors across multiple sectors to facilitate deals and business partnerships, strengthen regional economic integration, and improve business accountability, transparency, and competitiveness. DAI will use a facilitative ecosystem-strengthening approach that will increase trade and investment and improve corporate governance practices in Myanmar, supported by a $3.8 million Investment and Technical Assistance Facility that will allow RITA to deploy a flexible, tailored mix of pay-for-results subcontracts, grants, and technical assistance to partner firms. This structure facilitates our private sector engagement strategy, avoids market distortion, and prioritizes sustainability by building local capacity within the business ecosystem.
