The Nepal Biodiversity Activity works to reduce threats to ecosystems and species, conserve nature, and enhance human well-being in Nepal. Working in the Gandaki and Karnali river basins, the project will focus on improving ecosystem health, advancing environmental and social safeguards, promoting climate resilience, and addressing environmental crime in Nepal. We work with the Government of Nepal, civil society groups, local communities, and private sector actors, contributing to an emerging multidonor collaboration that supports Nepal’s green, inclusive, and resilient development.
