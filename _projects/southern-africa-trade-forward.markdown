[Trade Forward Southern Africa](https://tfsouthernafrica.org/) (TFSA) is a program designed to alleviate poverty across the Southern African Customs Union and Mozambique (SACU+M) by increasing the scale and quality of trade within the union as well as with the UK.

The program helps businesses meet the standards required for exporting to regional and international markets. It works primarily with and through Business Support Organisations (BSOs), such as export promotion agencies and chambers of commerce, to provide targeted support to various sectors. It has a strong focus on providing technical cooperation to export and near-export businesses, particularly female-owned entrepreneurs and sectors in which a greater proportion of women are employed.
