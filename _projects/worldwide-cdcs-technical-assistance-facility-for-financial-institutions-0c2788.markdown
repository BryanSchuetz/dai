The CDC Group is the U.K. Government’s development finance institution, supporting the growth of private businesses in Africa and South Asia. The Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) is helping CDC take a systemic approach to providing TA, delivering broader development impact beyond the direct outputs created by its investees thereby leveraging CDC’s position as a market influencer. 

CDC TAF is a three-year FCDO-funded program that supports the CDC in addressing two pressing priorities: i) inclusion and ii) climate change and environmental sustainability by catalyzing sustainable practice change in FIs through:

* TA support to CDC’s Financial Services Group Investees.  
* Design and delivery of research and events to promote shared learning.

The Facility aims to promote sustained practice changes in financial services providers leading to improvements in the relevance, quality, affordability, and/or accessibility of finance services for target populations, green sectors, and/or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The Facility seeks to bring about transformational change not only in the FIs where CDC has invested but also in the wider financial services market. Through generated evidence and focused TA, the Facility will help CDC investees demonstrate the business case for financial services that more visibly support CDC’s Enhanced Development Impact priorities

### Sample Activities

* Co-creating concept notes with CDC’s Financial Services Group and its investees, designing TA packages.
* Create new financial products according to ‘best fit’ – tailored to the local market context and the needs of the most vulnerable households, smallholder farmers, and SMEs, and that promote climate finance activities and upgrade environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.
* Ensure a diverse and balanced portfolio of research, event, and TA projects and use feedback back loops to maximize the synergies between the projects. 
* Select, contract and manage the performance of TA providers.
