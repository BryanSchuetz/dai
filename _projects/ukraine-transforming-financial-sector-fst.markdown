After years of oligarchic control, the closing of 76 banks, a threefold currency devaluation, and staggering economic decline, the Ukrainian financial sector remains fragile and in need of a massive overhaul. On the commercial side, these pressures have resulted in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) being unable to grow due to inaccessible loans with prohibitively high interest rates. Meanwhile, consumers who have lost both money and trust in the banking system after the 2009 financial crisis are opting out of using banks altogether and converting their salaries directly to cash on payday, all of which has contributed to bringing the country’s financial sector to the verge of collapse.

Despite these challenges, reformers within the Ukrainian Parliament and key regulatory bodies look to pass new financial sector legislation that will uphold transparency and accountability, protect businesses and consumers, and confront fraud and abuse, thereby restoring public confidence in the financial system. To capitalize on this momentum, the U.S. Agency for International Development has launched the Financial Sector Transformation (FST) Activity, which will play a pivotal role in supporting efforts to reform Ukraine’s non-bank financial institutions. FST will provide flexible and market-focused technical expertise to boost the involvement of consumers and businesses in shaping the reform process, while also working with policymakers to influence the legal changes needed to enable effective and long-lasting change.

At the heart of FST will be DAI’s market systems approach to inclusive financial sector programming, which will address both demand- and supply-side actors as well as seek to improve the wider business enabling environment of the financial sector. By increasing competition within the financial system and broadening service offerings, in particular to meet the needs of women and low-income and marginalized populations, FST will help to ensure that the benefits of new financial reforms are felt by all Ukrainians.
