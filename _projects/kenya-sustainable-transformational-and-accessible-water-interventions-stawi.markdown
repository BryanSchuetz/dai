More than two million people in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) of Kenya are suffering acute impacts of drought after three consecutive poor rainy seasons. Beyond the immediate impact on the population of the ASALs, the economic and destabilizing effects from crop failures and livestock deaths led the Government of Kenya (GOK) to declare a national emergency in 2021. Investments in policy, planning, infrastructure, and coordination by the GOK, counties, and development partners—including USAID—have laid the foundation for greater resilience, yet the ASALs still lack the capacity, tools, and information necessary to adopt and adapt effective approaches to manage recurrent drought, resource competition, and watershed degradation. The USAID Sustainable, Transformational, and Accessible Water Interventions (STAWI) Activity will play a critical role in building resilience and expanding economic opportunities in targeted northern and southeastern counties through investments in water security. After STAWI’s five years, targeted county governments, water service providers (WSPs), and water users will have the information, incentives, capacity, and partnerships they need to prioritize and address barriers to a water-secure future among the most water-stressed and vulnerable communities in 

The Kenya Sustainable Transformational and Accessible Water Interventions (STAWI) project plays a critical role in building resilience and expanding economic opportunities through investments in water security in Kenya’s arid and semi-arid lands.
 
Working across nine target counties in northern and southeastern Kenya—Garissa, Isiolo, Kitui, Makueni, Marsabit, Samburu, Taita Taveta, Turkana, and Wajir—STAWI supports county governments to deliver basic drinking water services to 250,000 Kenyans and improve water service quality for 500,000 Kenyans, while also strengthening institutions and improving water resource management. Through technical assistance, a construction fund, and a local grants fund, STAWI takes an inclusive and integrated approach to address needs for drinking water, water for productive uses, and water resource management while building local capacity for collaboration, learning, and adaptation.
 
Our local partners include the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has a long history of working to safeguard water availability in Kenya; FundiFix, a Kenyan-owned social enterprise providing rural water maintenance services; and Solstice, a women-owned U.S. small business that will expand the use of its mWater data management platform to help counties make data-informed decisions regarding water services and resources. STAWI collaborates with and complements the DAI-implemented [USAID Western Kenya Water Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-western-kenya-water-program).
