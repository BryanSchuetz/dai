In order to more sustainably invest in the social and economic development of the communities where it operates in Ghana, Kosmos Energy sought the expertise of the DAI Energy and Resources Group (ERG) to offer new approaches to local engagement beyond tradition models of corporate social responsibility (CSR). DAI helped to design, launch, and implement the Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) program to advance locally led, market-driven solutions to some of the country’s key challenges.

The KIC promotes innovation and youth employment by investing in, and facilitating the development of Ghanaian entrepreneurs and businesses, with a current focus on the agribusiness sector. The DAI ERG team provides capacity building support, personnel recruitment and management, stakeholder engagement, investment due diligence, and ongoing technical assistance to the Kosmos Innovation Center.
