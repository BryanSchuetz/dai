The Sustainable Business Group (SBG) is organizing a three-part series event, the Kenya Local Content Exchanges, to bring together public, private, and civil stakeholders from Kenya’s petroleum sector. 

The need for an open local content discussion was initiated by a commercial oil discovery of nearly 750 million barrels, which generated significant expectations across various stakeholder groups. The exchanges will help to identify and assemble key stakeholders in an accommodating environment to facilitate the discussion around single local content topic, produce the material from the outcomes of the events that could reach a wider readership, and create an understanding of the issue through provision of relevant examples of other nascent oil and gas economies provided by industry experts.
