A historical moment for Pakistan, the 2013 elections saw the country’s first democratic transfer of power from one civilian government to another. In light of the upcoming May 2018 elections for the National Assembly, it is crucial that the success of 2013 is not only replicated, but consolidated and strengthened to help ensure long-term, stable democracy in Pakistan. Furthermore, the fact that political power remains highly centralized and concentrated among a small group of elites and the 2013 election results being contested by the third largest political party in Pakistan both highlight the importance of holding accountable and widely accepted election in 2018.

To support this aim, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) has launched the Consolidating Democracy in Pakistan (CDIP) programme, which is working to increase the capacity, accountability, and responsiveness of Pakistan’s political institutions leading up to, and beyond the May 2018 elections. The CDIP team provides technical assistance to the Election Commission of Pakistan to improve its oversight of elections and helps members of parliament and political parties to better represent and respond to the needs of their constituents. In addition, the program works with civil society groups to increase the participation of Pakistani citizens in the policy making process, with a particular focus on engaging women, youth, people with disabilities, and ethnic and religious minorities.
