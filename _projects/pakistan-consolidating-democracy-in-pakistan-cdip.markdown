The Consolidating Democracy in Pakistan (CDIP) Programme, locally called *Tabeer*, was funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office's Conflict, Security and Stability Fund (CSSF) and jointly implemented by DAI and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-Strengthening Electoral and Legislative Processes (SELP). DAI managed the programme in a consortium with the British Council and the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT). It worked closely with the Election Commission of Pakistan, national and provincial assemblies, political parties, the media and civil society organisations.
 
The intended outcome of the programme was to contribute to the democratic system in which government institutions are more capable, parliament is more accountable, and the state is more responsive to citizens’ needs and aspirations. 
 
CDIP worked in four thematic areas, with a cross-cutting focus on increasing the engagement and [participation of women](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1585244/1-meeting-calls-simplify-process-get-cnic/) and other socially excluded groups: election management and election oversight; improving the transparency of parliamentary processes; improving the services and delivery of political parties; and improved policy dialogue, political debate, and public discourse.

### Sample Activities

* Support civil society groups to expand voter registration, electoral participation, and election observation.
* Build the communication and legislative drafting skills of key parliamentarians to help them more effectively represent their constituents.
* Engage with groups representing women, youth, and other marginalized populations to encourage their participation in policy debates and advocacy efforts.

### Select Results

* Held an event with 150 participants to observe 2017 International People With Disabilities Day. The event served as a platform for the Election Commission of Pakistan to inform the community about steps taken to accommodate voters with disabilities.
* Organised a National Dialogue about closing the gender gap in Pakistan’s Electoral Rolls. The dialogue opened with an expert briefing on the current situation, followed by a moderated roundtable by on key challenges and barriers to women’s voter registration, and a dialogue on policy recommendations to close the gender gap in electoral rolls.
* Helped register more than 184,000 [women as voters](/uploads/DAI-Tabeer's%20contribution%20to%20increase%20women's%20political%20participation.pdf).
* Reached 9.7 million citizens through a radio campaign stressing women’s electoral participation.
* Ran a media campaign to inform citizens about the process required to check and update their details in the national electoral rolls. Some 1.5 million people visited electoral roll display centres and almost 900,000 applied for changes.
* Supported the National Assembly of Pakistan to pass a landmark notification to establish a Special Committee on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities. The Assembly adopted all the recommendations the DAI team made in a recent policy paper on enhancing democratic inclusion and strengthening representation of marginalized groups.
* Supported the launch of the Punjab Environment Policy, which will promote legislation to teach environmental subjects in schools, create a youth climate advocacy network, and establish laboratories to monitor air and water quality in Punjab.
