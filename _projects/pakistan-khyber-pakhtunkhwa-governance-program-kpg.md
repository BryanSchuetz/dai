Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is Pakistan's smallest province, but it ranks third in population and economic activity. KP's relative vitality and diversity are offset by unstable public services and its vulnerability to militancy. The province, though, has seen incremental gains in stability in the past few years.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governance Program (KPG) will assist the provincial government and civil society organizations to implement an agenda that improves local government service and better serves KP citizens. It will establish and manage a mechanism for supporting activities that reinforce stability, counter extremism, and promote democratic inclusiveness, including for women and other marginalized groups.

### Select Activities

* Leverage current KP government initiatives and systems with government taking the lead role.
* Deliver integrated assistance packages in areas such as training government units to improve services and accountability.
* Improve government's publicizing of its successes, services, and opportunities available for its citizens—especially women and vulnerable groups—as well as its receptivity to community input.
* Incorporate a rigorous system for adaptive learning and management in areas such as grant making, procurement, operations, and monitoring and evaluation.
