The Feed the Future Inclusive Agricultural Markets (IAM) Activity works to increase incomes and improve livelihoods in Uganda by promoting agriculture-led economic growth.
 
IAM takes a [market systems development](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/market-systems-development-a-primer-on-pro-poor-programming?utm_source=daidotcom) approach. It builds the capacity of Government of Uganda institutions and of private sector and civil society organizations, and seeks to create incentives for agro-industry and agribusiness firms to invest and respond to changes in the market system. 
 
Inclusivity lies at the heart of IAM. The team focuses on strengthening the market integration of “zone of influence” districts and of marginalized groups including women, youth, refugees, their host communities, and the people of [Karamoja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja)—Uganda’s least economically developed region. IAM will ensure that 60 percent of those benefitting from the activities are women and 40 percent are young people.
