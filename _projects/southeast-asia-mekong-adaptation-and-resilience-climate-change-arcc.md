summary: "Sixty million people living in Southeast Asia's Mekong River Basin are sustained by the river. This is especially true for the 75 percent whose livelihoods and food security depend on agriculture and fisheries, and who face grave threats from the impacts of climate change, including crop failure."

Sixty million people living in Southeast Asia's Mekong River Basin are sustained by the river. This is especially true for the 75 percent whose livelihoods and food security depend on agriculture and fisheries, and who face grave threats from the impacts of climate change, including crop failure.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s [Mekong ARCC][1] project is bridging the knowledge gap between high-level science and local responses to help communities become more resilient. The project has identified critical environmental, economic, and social impacts in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). We are now assisting select rural communities in Laos, PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam to strengthen their adaptation capacity in the face of climate change risks to water resources, agricultural systems, biodiversity, ecosystems, and livelihood opportunities.

###  Sample Activities

* Build regional platform partnerships to act as knowledge centers of climate change adaptation.
* Implement local initiatives in Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam that draw on indigenous experience and build capacity for making science-based decisions and policies.
* Assess ecosystem services, including monetizing the impacts of climate change on crops and fisheries, to assist policymakers and planners in understanding tradeoffs between economic decisions and environmental impact.
* Scale up successful pilots and promote their sustainability.

###  Select Results

* Published a comprehensive, basin-wide [Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Study][3] that has informed the project's selection of priority vulnerable provinces for activities.
* Presented USAID Mekong ARCC to senior government officials from the region and the United States at the Lower Mekong Initiative Regional Working Group, a partnership of the Mekong riparian countries dedicated to building cooperation and capacity to address transnational issues.
* Conducted preliminary analysis of the LMB that estimated at $34 billion the annual values at risk from climate change impacts on infrastructure services and assets, worker productivity, agricultural output, hydroelectrical power, and eco-system services.
* Secured the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences' [commitment][4] to promote the USAID Mekong ARCC model throughout Asia as part of their approach to climate change.
