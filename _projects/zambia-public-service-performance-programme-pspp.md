Zambia is a middle-income country but poverty is still widespread and service delivery is unsatisfactory. This five-year programme is supporting the Government of Zambia (GRZ) to improve the delivery of public goods and services.

We will support a Zambian-led process, building sustained capacity in the Cabinet Office, which has a central role in driving up efficiency and holding line ministries accountable. PSPP will aim for a balance between rural and urban issues, and an appropriate geographic spread. Where possible, PSPP will develop links and achieve synergy with other Zambia programmes of the U.K. Department for International Development.

PSPP will address three projects to start: Agricultural Policy and Programmes, with an initial focus on agricultural extension services, particularly to poor farmers in remote, rural areas; Employment Policies and Programmes, with an initial focus on the significant unemployment among urban youth; and Service Delivery Programmes: Accessing Birth Certificates, which are fundamental to effectively participating in society and basic rights such as health care, education, inheritance, access to a passport, opening a bank account, or obtaining credit.

###  Sample Activities

* Solve particular public service problems, includes ones that have implications to the public service system as a whole.
* Establish a methodology for using a problem-solving approach to increase productivity of public service delivery, which can be deployed sustainably and systemically.
* Reinforce the role of Cabinet Office in leading, supporting, and holding line ministries accountable for improvements in productivity and delivery of public services.
