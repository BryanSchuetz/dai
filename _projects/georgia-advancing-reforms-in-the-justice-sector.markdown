As Georgia aspires to EU membership, strengthening the rule of law and reforming the justice sector is important. Over the past few years, Georgia has made progress with judicial reforms, constitutional amendments, anti-discrimination laws, and measures against organized crime and the EU continues to support the country to prioritize human rights. 

The Advancing Reforms in the Justice Sector in Georgia project aims to continue initiatives that support judicial reform, foster security, equality, and democratic participation by improving human rights protection and criminal justice, reducing violence against women, and boosting civil society engagement. The project will also improve investigation and prosecution quality, enhance the response to crimes against vulnerable groups, and advance restorative justice initiatives.
