The Uganda Feed the Future Water and Food Systems for Resilient Communities Activity addresses water and food insecurity in three water catchments encompassing the Karamoja region and parts of the Teso and Bugisu subregions of northeast Uganda. This area is home to nomadic pastoralists whose livelihoods are at risk due to violent cattle raiding and the effects of climate change such as drought and flooding. This part of Uganda also suffers from fragmented markets, chronic underinvestment in public services, and a lack of private-sector investment.
 
With our partners, we are enhancing market systems, strengthening relevant institutions, expanding access to climate-resilient services, and—in two of the most vulnerable of the 20 districts covered by the activity—employ “graduation” approaches to assist the ultra-poor. All our initiatives will incorporate conflict sensitivity, local leadership, climate change adaptation, and approaches inclusive of women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and indigenous groups.
 
The activity includes a $10 million small-scale infrastructure fund, a $4 million local subcontracting fund, and a $2 million grant partnership fund.
 
This win solidifies our position as a trusted U.S. Government partner in Uganda. Many thanks and congratulations to the successful proposal team.
