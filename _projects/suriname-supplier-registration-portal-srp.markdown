DAI’s Supplier Registration Portal (SRP) matches local suppliers with buyers (such as operators and primary contractors) and helps foreign suppliers form alliances with local vendors to access protected local markets. DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) provided an SPR for a multinational corporation to serve as a business registration system for local firms seeking work in their major supply chains. The SRP also allows engagement and communication with local businesses by sharing opportunity notifications and other critical information.
