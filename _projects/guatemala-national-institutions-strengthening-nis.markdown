The Guatemala National Institutions Strengthening (NIS) Project supports the Government of Guatemala’s reform efforts, focused on creating a more effective and transparent public financial management (PFM) system, which will in turn improve governance, reduce opportunities for corruption, enhance public service delivery, and deter illegal migration.
 
Building on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s achievements through the predecessor [Fiscal Procurement and Reform Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guatemala-fiscal-and-procurement-reform-project-fprp)—also implemented by DAI—NIS supports the national Planning Secretariat, the Tax Administration, the Ministry of Finance, and the Presidential Commission for Open and Electronic Government to bolster their institutional capacities to increase tax revenue, improve budget planning and public procurement, and enhance transparency and oversight in the use of public resources. NIS also engages civil society to catalyze improvements in Guatemala’s domestic resource mobilization, PFM systems, and fiscal transparency and accountability.
