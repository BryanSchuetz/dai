The Green Economy Program (GEP), a follow-on to DAI’s successful [Georgia Economic Security Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/georgia-usaid-economic-security-program-georgia-esp). This next-generation USAID program will improve the productivity and economic competitiveness of Georgian enterprises in the tourism, light manufacturing, digital, and solid waste management sectors, while strengthening Georgia’s economic ecosystem to support further growth in these areas.
 
The program helps enterprises increase sales, expand exports to Western markets, attract investment, and create high-value jobs. GEP also works to reduce the  environmental footprint of firms in the targeted sectors and catalyze a shift toward low-carbon, climate-resilient development, thereby helping Georgia meet the requirements of its EU Association Agreement.
