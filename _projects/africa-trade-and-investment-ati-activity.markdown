The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Africa Trade and Investment activity is designed to bolster the Agency’s ability to boost trade and investment to, from, and within the African continent. As USAID’s flagship effort under the Prosper Africa initiative, the continent-wide program expands and accelerates two-way trade and investment between African nations and the United States.  

The program works with the African private sector to achieve Africa’s vision for inclusive economic growth. Over the five-year program lifecycle, the project intends to generate thousands of jobs across the African continent and within the United States, deliver billions in exports and investments, mobilize private sector-driven solutions, and create healthy business environments.  

As a demand-driven mechanism, the project is flexible and responsive. The Africa Trade and Investment activity brings together a tested network of partners that can work across the intersection of trade and investment, deploying proven approaches testing new finance solutions, and building partnerships for sustainability and scale. 

The platform is collectively funded by all users (Prosper Africa and participating USAID Buy-in Missions and Offices) and aims for cost-effective, rapid, and flexible deployment of the most critical shared services. The more ATI can scale, the more the costs are shared.
