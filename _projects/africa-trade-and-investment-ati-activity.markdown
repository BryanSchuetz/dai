The Africa Trade and Investment (ATI) Activity is a whole-of-government platform to help African and U.S. businesses double two-way trade and investment, thereby solidifying Africa’s place as a significant trading partner of the United States.
 
ATI builds on the highly successful [INVEST](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-the-invest-project) model to deliver demand-driven development at scale by working directly with the private sector as implementers, co-investors, service providers, and general business partners, with ATI serving as a facilitator for trade and investment deals across the continent. A buy-in contract, ATI is multisectoral and will work across Southern, Eastern, Western, and Northern Africa through regional “Hubs” and also through whole-of-government Embassy Deal Teams to identify trade and investment deals, de-risk and incentivize transactions, and bring to scale the most promising opportunities.
  
Our core partners include CrossBoundary, McKinsey & Company, and Ndarama Works.
