The Africa Trade and Investment (ATI) program is a five-year, flexible buy-in mechanism managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Bureau for Africa. USAID’s flagship effort under the [Prosper Africa](https://www.prosperafrica.gov/) initiative, ATI will boost trade, increase investment, and support healthy business climates across the African continent. ATI works with USAID missions, bureaus, and independent offices to mobilize enterprise-driven solutions and achieve development outcomes across North and sub-Saharan Africa.  

As a demand-driven mechanism, ATI is flexible and responsive. ATI brings together a tested network of partners that can work across the intersection of trade and investment, deploying proven approaches testing new finance solutions, and building partnerships for sustainability and scale.
