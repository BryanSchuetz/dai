The Africa Trade and Investment (ATI) program is a five-year, flexible buy-in mechanism managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Bureau for Africa. USAID’s flagship effort under the [Prosper Africa](https://www.prosperafrica.gov/) initiative, ATI will boost trade, increase investment, and support healthy business climates across the African continent. ATI works with USAID missions, bureaus, and independent offices to mobilize enterprise-driven solutions and achieve development outcomes across North and sub-Saharan Africa.  

As a demand-driven mechanism, ATI is flexible and responsive. ATI brings together a tested network of partners that can work across the intersection of trade and investment, deploying proven approaches testing new finance solutions, and building partnerships for sustainability and scale.

ATI is designed to unlock billions in exports and investments and generate thousands of jobs across African nations and the United States. We work hand-in-hand with buy-in clients to shape activities that unlock business opportunities and meet private sector needs.
