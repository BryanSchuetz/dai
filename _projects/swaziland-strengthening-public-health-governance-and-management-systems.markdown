Strengthening health care and decentralizing hospitals in Swaziland remain a key strategy for improved health care delivery, and require clear governance and enhanced management capacity at this level of service delivery.

The Swaziland Ministry of Health National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2014-2018 aims to strengthen the governance and management capacity of the Ministry of Health and health institutions to effectively and efficiently perform and discharge core health sector functions. The institutional development strategy focuses on building a distinctive organizational culture, promoting values related to work processes and recognition systems, including institutional growth, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability.

DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International is supporting the Ministry of Health in the implementation of the Government’s institutional and management reform initiatives. 

Sample Activities

* Hold stakeholder consultations and perform diagnostic assessments of the status of governance and management in the health sector with an emphasis on hospitals, involving qualitative and quantitative information.
ii) Options for governance models and management structures, drawing from lessons, experiences and discussions from the resultant situation analysis.

iii) A set of governance and management tools and processes to support effective implementation of the reforms across all levels of care.

iv) An implementation roadmap.

Through improving governance and management structures, models and processes, and promoting results-driven service provision, the project will contribute to broader sector outcomes, such as efficiency and sustainability of health financing, improvements in the quality of care, and better health outcomes.

The project is funded jointly by the World Bank and the European Union. The consortium contracted to implement the project is led by Health Partners Southern Africa (HPSA) in partnership with Health Information Systems Program (HISP), the Institute for Health Measurement (IHM) and Strategic Development Consultants (SDC).
