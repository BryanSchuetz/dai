Following the turmoil of a contested presidential election in 2016, The Gambia faced an uncertain future. While the population had high expectations for the political transition, an economic crisis along with the state's inability to provide basic public services threatened the country’s stability. Fortunately, peaceful parliamentary elections in 2017 paved the way for policymakers to restore fiscal sustainability and lay the groundwork for the country’s economic recovery.

To support these democratic reforms, The State Building Contract 1 Complementary Support (SBC1 CS) programme, funded by the European Commission, fosters inclusive growth and improves political and economic governance in The Gambia. DAI provides expert coaches to train government staff on leading reforms within key institutions. The SBC1 CS technical assistance focuses on human rights and rule of law; public financial management and procurement; statistical data collection and management; and business environment reform.
