The Fiscal Reform Activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina builds on recent fiscal sector reform in a way that increases efficiency, reduces tax compliance costs, and aligns the country’s regulatory framework with changes in the European and international tax environment. 

## Sample Activities
 
* Produce analysis, reports, and recommendations for the various tax administrations and ministries of finance that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina’s complex fiscal landscape: the Tax Administration in the Republic of Srpska, Tax Administration in Brcko District, Ministry of Finance for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Srpska, the Directorate of Finance of Brcko District, and the State-level Ministry of Finance.
* Implement the recommendations arising from those reports and analyses.
* Improve the operational efficiency, efficacy, and capacity of the three tax administrations and the ministries of finance.
* Improve the legislative framework for direct taxation.
* Reduce the number of parafiscal fees, which are taxes or duties on a specific product or service, usually paid to a public authority other than the tax authority.
