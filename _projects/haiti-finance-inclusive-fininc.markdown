Initiatives to increase financial inclusion have yet to translate into significant expansion of relevant services in Haiti. Only 19 percent of Haitian adults have an account with a financial institution, while only 9 percent of adults save and 5 percent borrow from a financial institution. These figures are among the lowest not just in the Latin American and Caribbean region, but globally. 

The Haiti Finance Inclusive (FinInc) project tackles enabling environment and market coordination issues to increase financial inclusion in a way that creates lasting benefits for low-income people across Haiti. By accessing basic, more formal financial services, low-income people are able to accumulate assets, withstand financial shocks, invest in businesses, and more conveniently receive and send money and make payments. 

FinInc is facilitating a two-level change in the market system: 1) behavior of market actors through better information availability and increased orientation around low-income market segments, and 2) deeper collaboration in the broader financial ecosystem and enabling environment.

### Sample Activities

* Develop a private sector financial inclusion platform, and strengthen existing financial sector associations: Association National des Institutions de Microfinance d’Haïti (ANIMH) and Association Nationale des Caisses Populaires Haïtiennes (ANACAPH). 
* Increase information and research activities to enhance understanding of key low-income market segments and gender aspects of financial inclusion to encourage the development of relevant products and services that correspond to livelihoods strategies of low-income market segments. 
* Support the development of an active consumer protection environment to ensure that low-income Haitians understand the financial products offered to them and to improve uptake of available services, particularly digital financial services.
