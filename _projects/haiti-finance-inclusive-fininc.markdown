The Haiti Finance Inclusive (FinInc) project supports the development of the enabling environment to increase the usage of basic financial services by undeserved and unserved households and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMES) in rural and agricultural areas in Haiti. By accessing basic, more formal financial services, low-income people are able to accumulate assets, withstand financial shocks, invest in businesses, and more conveniently receive and send money and make payments. FinInc tackles enabling environment and market coordination issues to increase financial inclusion in a way that creates lasting benefits for low-income people across Haiti. 

FinInc is facilitating a two-level change in the market system: 1) behavior of market actors through better information availability and increased orientation around low-income market segments, and 2) deeper collaboration in the broader financial ecosystem and enabling environment.

### Sample Activities

* Build institutional capacity of the financial inclusion working group, Haitian Alliance for Financial Inclusion (HALFI), and strengthen existing financial sector association, Association National des Institutions de Microfinance d’Haïti (ANIMH), Association Professionnelle des Banques (APB), and Association Nationale des Caisses Populaires Haïtiennes (ANACAPH). 

* Increase information and research activities to enhance understanding of key low-income market segments and gender aspects of financial inclusion to encourage the development of relevant products and services that correspond to livelihoods strategies of low-income market segments. 

* Train financial institutions to ensure that low-income Haitians understand the financial products offered to them and to improve uptake of available services, particularly digital financial services.
