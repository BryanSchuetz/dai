Funded by the U.K. Prosperity Fund, the Global Trade Programme (GTP) provides technical assistance and support to facilitate free trade and open markets for target middle-income countries: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam. This assistance aims to enable greater investment and interaction with global value chains to create jobs and prosperity and help reduce poverty. GTP delivers secondary benefits through increasing market access for international business, including from the United Kingdom, as well as build bilateral partnerships on trade-related issues with key emerging markets, increasing our understanding of future trading partners, in support of the U.K. trade strategy.
