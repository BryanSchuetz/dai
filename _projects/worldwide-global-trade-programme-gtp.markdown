Funded by the U.K. Prosperity Fund, the Global Trade Programme (GTP) provided support to facilitate free trade and open markets for target middle-income countries: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam. This assistance enabled greater investment and interaction with global value chains to create jobs and prosperity and help reduce poverty. GTP delivered secondary benefits through increasing market access for international business, including from the United Kingdom, as well as built bilateral partnerships on trade-related issues with key emerging markets, increasing our understanding of future trading partners, in support of the U.K. trade strategy.
 
In conjunction with the lead contractor EY, DAI’s component provided policy and advisory services for the design of GTP sub-programmes for the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office.
