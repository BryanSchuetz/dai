Development cooperation is a key tool for supporting European Union (EU) partner countries to improve the lives of their citizens and achieve their development goals. For this purpose, the EU commits significant resources to contribute to the achievement of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) and other key international commitments by overcoming challenges such as aid fragmentation and decrease in development effectiveness. 

The [Global Gateway](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/global-gateway_en) is the EU’s new connectivity strategy that aims to create smart, sustainable, and secure links with countries around the world in different thematic areas. The Strategy is delivered through a Team Europe approach, which brings together the EU and EU Member States with their financial and development institutions, including the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

This project will support European Commission’s Headquarter (EC HQ), EU Delegations (EUDs) and partner countries to deliver on Global Gateway Strategy through implementation of the Team Europe approach and bringing together funding from the EU, its Member States and European financial institutions. The project will furthermore support EU efforts to achieving more effective development cooperation and support EU engagement within the The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation.

The intervention will establish and operate a demand-driven Technical Assistance Facility in close   coordination with Directorate-General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA) and Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR). Our team will deliver a range of assignments in the fields of joint programming, Team Europe, Global Gateway, development effectiveness, development financing and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
