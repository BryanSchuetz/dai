Recent years have seen the Egyptian economy struggle to stabilize, with weak economic governance at the macro and microeconomic levels, contributing to distortions that have hampered private sector growth and dampened Egypt’s economic development. The recent devaluation of the Egyptian pound has helped to encourage foreign direct investment and increased exports, but there remain macroeconomic issues, such as the public debt and high inflation, that continue to inhibit economic growth in Egypt. 

The Macro-Economic Stabilization and Reform (MESR) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, will address Egypt’s macroeconomic challenges, assist with implementing reforms expected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and set the stage for broad-based economic growth and achievement of the Sustainable Development Strategy 2030. The IMF’s arrangement under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with Egypt creates a sense of urgency for reforms and encourages government champions to take ownership. Complementing the EFF arrangement, MESR will focus on human capacity building and institutional development to promote sustainability of reforms and empower government staff to improve capital investment processes and the effectiveness of public finance systems. 

MESR will also work with the Government of Egypt to analyze, monitor, and evaluate the impact of public investments and economic policies on men and women, while ensuring that women are well represented in training and capacity development efforts, engaged in economic policy dialogue, and prepared for managerial and leadership opportunities. While ambitious in its expected results, MESR comes at a critical time for Egypt and will provide invaluable technical assistance to support macroeconomic stabilization.
