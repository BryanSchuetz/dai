Digital technologies are accelerating change across the developing world–from mobile money platforms that allow rural farmers to access credit, to data-driven modeling that improves a country’s natural resource planning. While digital tools have proven effective in a variety of isolated settings, development organizations often lack the knowledge management and resources to scale up these successes. In addition, even well-intentioned digital solutions can end up excluding vulnerable populations or dying out without a sustainable business model.

To foster a more inclusive and robust global digital ecosystem, the Digital Frontiers (DF) project works with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Center for Digital Development (CDD) to identify the most successful digital solutions and scale up their impact. Through DF, DAI manages a catalytic grant fund that supports innovators around the world in using digital tools to tackle development challenges–from digital financial services and identity management to digital inclusion and development informatics.

### Sample Activities
