This 4½-year design and implement project in the Niger Delta is applying a market development approach (M4P) to improve market access, increase economic activity, and raise the incomes of 150,000 poor people, half of whom will be women. We are initially focusing on the critical constraints to pro-poor growth in the value chains of palm oil, aquaculture and fisheries, agricultural inputs, and backyard poultry. Activities will stimulate private sector provision of services and promote innovative, inclusive business models that reach a large number of low-income households.

The first year of the project focused on drafting the Business Case and implementing pilot activities in the target value chains. With approval of the Business Case in July 2014, the Implementation Phase will proceed through March 2018. Working out of Port Harcourt, MADE works closely with the Chevron-funded Partnership Initiative for the Niger Delta (PIND) implementing synergistic activities across the nine states.

###  Sample Activities

* Select and analyze key value chains.
* Conduct market, environmental, conflict, and political economy analyses and draft the Business Case.
