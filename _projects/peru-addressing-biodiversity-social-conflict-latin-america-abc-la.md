The increase of mining, logging, and oil and gas development in Latin America has led to chronic low-grade conflict and periodic violence in communities in or near extraction zones. ABC-LA worked to create conditions that enable local people to drive conflict resolution in Peru and Colombia. The project worked to lay a foundation for key actors to address the causes of this conflict and lead transformative changes that reduce negative impacts to both vulnerable communities and the environment.

ABC-LA improved the capacities of indigenous and minority communities and local and regional governments, leading to greater inclusion of marginalized groups. It focused on biologically significant areas in Colombia and Peru where there is ongoing or potential conflict associated with extractive activities.

###  Sample Activities                            

* Develop conflict early warning systems, tools and methodologies for prevention, and response skills for key stakeholders.
* Identify gaps in participation by vulnerable populations. Reach out to and engage nonparticipating stakeholders.
* Promote multi-stakeholder dialogue on the rights to prior consultation, and on best practices for social and environmental impact assessment.
* Train institutions and organizations to improve inclusive processes and mechanisms in Land Use Planning.
* Support the development and validation of inclusive land-use proposals linked with Life Planning, Regional Development Planning, and Environmental and Economic Zoning while strengthening local capacity to do the same.

###  Select Results

* Nearly 790,000 hectares are now under improved natural resource management. The project's original goal was 100,000 hectares.
* Assisted eight local governments in crafting governance plans that include improved protection of biodiversity and natural resource governance with input from local communities.
* Launched 16 new groups or initiatives dedicated to resolving socio-environmental conflict or the drivers of conflict in high-biodiversity areas. Key stakeholders in 10 municipalities have demonstrated capacity to contribute to local socio-environmental conflict early warning mechanisms.
* Trained 2,006 people in natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, and socio-environmental conflict identification, prevention, and response, for a total of 25,655 person-hours training.
