summary: Despite positive economic growth in recent years, urban Indonesia still suffers
  from one of the lowest rates of access to safe water and improved sanitation in
  the region. USAID’s IUWASH Penyehatan Lingkungan untuk Semua, or Environmental Health
  for All (IUWASH PLUS), is working to expand access to water and sanitation services
  to hundreds of thousands of low-income urban households.

Better management of urban growth will be crucial to guarantee sustainable cities. It is not uncommon for citizens in and around Indonesia’s major cities for residents to spend up to two hours a day transporting expensive water to their homes for drinking and cooking. In addition, a lack of sewage and wastewater infrastructure in many densely populated, low-income areas leads to tainted ground and surface water, creating serious health risks from waterborne diseases.

USAID’s Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation and Hygiene—Penyehatan Lingkungan untuk Semua, or Environmental Health for All—(IUWASH PLUS) project and its predecessor, IUWASH, have brought reliable water supply to more than 3 million people and safely managed [sanitation services](https://medium.com/usaid-global-waters/strengthening-urban-indonesias-water-and-sanitation-systems-geser-si-jahat-out-with-the-bad-fa3772d5cc6b) to more 600,000 city dwellers. The IUWASH PLUS team works with civil society groups and local governments to mobilize demand for improved drinking water and sanitation services, as well as to build the capacity of private businesses, utilities, and national-level programs to provide these services in a fair and sustainable fashion.![IUWASH_image.jpg](/uploads/IUWASH_image.jpg)

### Sample Activities

* Engage local entrepreneurs in developing innovative WASH products and services through challenge competitions, such as designing affordable pressure sensors for leak detection or creating new urban septic waste removal services.

* Work with business associations to build capacity and develop standard certifications for companies involved in water and sanitation services.
* Support cooperatives, community credit organizations, and commercial banks in providing consumer and small business loans for WASH-related projects.
* Support citizen engagement in the WASH sector through radio programming, civic forums, text message gateways, complaint hotlines, and social media, as well as designing a crowdsourcing platform to collect and display citizen feedback.
