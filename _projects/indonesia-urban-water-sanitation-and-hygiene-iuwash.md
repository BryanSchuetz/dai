Despite positive economic growth in recent years, urban Indonesia still suffers from poor access to safe water and sanitation. It’s not uncommon for citizens in and around Indonesia’s major cities to spend up to two hours every day transporting expensive water to their homes for drinking and cooking. In addition, a lack of sewage and wastewater infrastructure in many densely populated, low-income areas creates serious health risks from waterborne diseases.

Over the past five years, the [Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene](http://iuwash.or.id/) (IUWASH) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by DAI, made notable progress in addressing these deficiencies at many levels. IUWASH collaborated with public and private sector partners to bring a reliable water supply to more than 2.2 million people. USAID’s IUWASH Penyehatan Lingkungan untuk Semua, or Environmental Health for All (IUWASH PLUS), will build upon this momentum by working to expand access to water and sanitation services to hundreds of thousands of low-income urban households.

DAI’s approach involves strengthening the urban WASH ecosystem at all levels—from basic infrastructure to public policy. The IUWASH PLUS team will work with civil society groups and local governments to mobilize demand for improved drinking water and [sanitation services](https://www.globalwaters.org/resources/blogs/professionalizing-septic-tank-and-latrine-desludging-indonesia) as well as to build capacity of private businesses, utilities, and national-level programs to provide these vital services in a fair and sustainable fashion.

### Sample Activities

* Engage local entrepreneurs in developing innovative WASH products and services through challenge competitions, such as designing affordable pressure sensors for leak detection or creating new urban septic waste removal services.

* Engage women at each stage of WASH delivery, from latrine design and construction to gender-based planning and budgeting with government partners.

* Work with business associations to build capacity and develop standard certifications for companies involved in water and sanitation services.

* Support cooperatives, community credit organizations, and commercial banks in providing consumer and small business loans for WASH-related projects.

* Support citizen engagement in the WASH sector through radio programming, civic forums, text message gateways, complaint hotlines, and social media, as well as designing a crowdsourcing platform to collect and display citizen feedback.
