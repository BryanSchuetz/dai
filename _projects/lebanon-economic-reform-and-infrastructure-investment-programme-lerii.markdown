Awarded under the U.K. Department for International Development’s General Economic Development Framework, LERII assists the Lebanese government in implementing key economic reforms, reaches agreement on the construction of key donor-financed infrastructure projects, and ensures that such projects are successfully built and operated. A more sustainable and higher growth economy, accompanied by infrastructure investments, has the potential to significantly improve poor people’s lives, including girls and women and the large number of refugees currently in Lebanon. 

With our partner, the Lebanese Economic Association, DAI provides technical assistance to the government ministries and agencies charged with planning and delivering infrastructure and economic reforms. This demand-driven assistance focuses on problems identified directly by the Lebanese government, such that national stakeholders are engaged in the solutions and more likely to sustain their results.
