The hurricanes of 2017 devastated the infrastructure of the British Virgin Islands. More than one third of residential buildings suffered significant damage while crippled maritime facilities hindered the return of vital economic activities. In order to achieve the government’s long-term recovery plan of building back better, stronger, and greener, the local labour force requires upskilling and building and labour regulations need revising.

In response, the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is building the capacity of the local workforce to participate in recovery efforts. DAI is leading this initiative by designing and implementing vocational training programs to help underemployed populations meet the rising demand for skilled labour in the construction and maritime industries. In addition, DAI’s team supports the government of the British Virgin Islands to develop labour policies that meet the needs of the current recovery process and create long-term employment opportunities.

* Advise on regulations to boost resilience in housing codes and on labour market policies to maximise the trickle-down effects of recovery efforts.
