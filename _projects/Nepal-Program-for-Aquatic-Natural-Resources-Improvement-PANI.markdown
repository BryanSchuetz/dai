title: Nepal—Program for Aquatic Natural Resources Improvement (PANI)

summary: The water that courses through Nepal’s great Karnali, Mahakali, and Rapti
  river basins irrigates the region’s farmland and sustains the health of its people,
  while also providing a critical habitat for diverse freshwater species, and propelling
  the hydroelectric dams that help to power the country. However, important water
  resources such as these are increasingly strained by population growth, climate
  change, and indiscriminate use—stressors that will become more severe if left unchecked.

The water that courses through Nepal’s great Karnali, Mahakali, and Rapti river basins irrigates the region’s farmland and sustains the health of its people, while also providing a critical habitat for diverse freshwater species, and propelling the hydroelectric dams that help to power the country. However, important water resources such as these are increasingly strained by population growth, climate change, and indiscriminate use—stressors that will become more severe if left unchecked.

The Program for Aquatic Natural Resources Improvement (PANI), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, plays a pivotal role in protecting these critical water resources by working with local and national counterparts to conserve freshwater biodiversity and implement sustainable water management practices.

PANI works to raise the profile of freshwater issues through policy engagement, academic research, curriculum development, and sponsorship of international forums. PANI emphasizes user-centered design to analyze how various stakeholders, including fishermen, government officials, and hydropower developers, use water resources to better incentivize their engagement in water conservation and management activities.

### Sample Activities

* Train diverse groups (engineers, teachers, planners, village groups, and government staff) in the importance of and methods for freshwater conservation and protection of local ecosystems.
* Create multi-stakeholder platforms to share lessons, plans, and news through roundtable discussions and information communication and technology tools such as websites, social media, listservs, and text messages.
* Create a Freshwater Center of Excellence to serve as a repository for technical tools, training, and scientific assessments and transition knowledge to local institutions for sustainability.
* Collaborate with engineering and construction firms and government ministries to develop best practices guide for green infrastructure construction.
* Develop and implement a university-level green engineering curriculum and provide scholarships, internships, and/or mentorships for Nepali students pursuing related fields.
