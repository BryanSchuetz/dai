The water that courses through Nepal’s great Karnali, Mahakali, and Rapti river basins irrigates the region’s farmland and sustains the health of its people, while also providing a critical habitat for diverse freshwater species, and propelling the hydroelectric dams that help to power the country. However, important water resources such as these are increasingly strained by population growth, climate change, and indiscriminate use—stressors that will become more severe if left unchecked.

The Paani (meaning “water” in Nepali) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, plays a pivotal role in protecting these critical water resources by working with local and national counterparts to conserve freshwater biodiversity and implement sustainable water management practices.

Paani works to raise the profile of freshwater issues through policy engagement, academic research, curriculum development, and sponsorship of international forums. The project emphasizes user-centered design to analyze how various stakeholders, including fishermen, government officials, and hydropower developers, use water resources to better incentivize their engagement in water conservation and management activities.

### Sample Activities

* Train diverse groups (engineers, teachers, planners, village groups, and government staff) in the importance of and methods for freshwater conservation and protection of local ecosystems.
* Create multi-stakeholder platforms to share lessons, plans, and news through roundtable discussions and information communication and technology tools such as websites, social media, listservs, and text messages.
* Create a Freshwater Center of Excellence to serve as a repository for technical tools, training, and scientific assessments and transition knowledge to local institutions for sustainability.
* Collaborate with engineering and construction firms and government ministries to develop best practices guide for green infrastructure construction.
* Develop and implement a university-level green engineering curriculum and provide scholarships, internships, and/or mentorships for Nepali students pursuing related fields.

### Select Results

* Developed an Aquatic Animals and Biodiversity Conservation Bill which was endorsed by three municipalities, demonstrating the success and importance of working at all levels of government simultaneously while Nepal’s new government structure falls into place.
* Launched an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) course and scholarship program at Mid-Western University. The scholarship program expands the reach of the program to humanities and social science students, as well as those from marginalized backgrounds.
* Through engaging hundreds of citizen scientists, completed comprehensive watershed profiles and watershed health reports for eight priority watersheds. These reports, and the consultative process that was used to create them, narrow the knowledge gap and create a shared understanding of ecosystem health.
