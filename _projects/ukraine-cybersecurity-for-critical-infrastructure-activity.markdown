Ukraine is engaged in an ongoing hybrid, asymmetric, and kinetic struggle against cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s energy sectors—oil and gas, nuclear, electricity, and hydroelectric systems—are a particular target of cyber-aggression, as evidenced by the [2014 Sandworm attacks](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/russian-sandworm-hack-isight/). These attacks, and others, pose complex and novel challenges that require Ukraine to respond rapidly, deploy effective countermeasures, and build new defenses against future attacks from a range of potential internal and external malicious actors.

### Sample Activities

* Create a cybersecurity research and training lab and support the ecosystem needed to provide and develop solutions that meet Ukrainian demand for cybersecurity products and services that also have global market potential.
* Work with the government to review existing or drafted cybersecurity legislation, policies, and strategies, and develop an approach for the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to create a national Cybersecurity Roadmap.
* Establish a communications and liaison office to increase stakeholder engagement and coordination.
* Perform large-scale tabletop exercises to test and reinforce developed response procedures to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
* Build the capacity of security operations center analysts, system designers, risk managers, and auditors on topics that are relevant to their responsibilities.
