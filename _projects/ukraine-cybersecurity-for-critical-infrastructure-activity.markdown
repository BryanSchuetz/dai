Ukraine is engaged in an ongoing struggle against cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s energy sectors—oil and gas, nuclear, electricity, and hydroelectric systems—are a particular target. Hybrid campaigns against Ukraine continue, with a marked increase in targeted spear-phishing campaigns against Government of Ukraine employees. 

These attacks, and others, pose complex and novel challenges that require Ukraine to respond rapidly, deploy effective countermeasures, and build new defenses against future attacks from a range of potential internal and external malicious actors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Activity works to strengthen the resilience of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure from cyberattacks by establishing trusted collaboration between key cybersecurity stakeholders in the government, private sector, academia, and civil society.

The activity contributes to improved cybersecurity in Ukraine. Increasing organizational and technical capacity in key institutions and ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is prepared to take on these challenges are the activity’s priorities, as well as building the foundation for improved preparedness based on an effective legal regulatory framework, effective communication between stakeholders, and engagement with the private sector. In addition, the activity supports a secure digital transformation in Ukraine by providing testing of e-services and engaging a broader community of experts and testers.

### Sample Activities

* With the government, review existing or drafted cybersecurity legislation, policies, and strategies, and develop an approach for the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to create a national Cybersecurity Roadmap.
* Build government capacity to implement key cybersecurity initiatives in critical infrastructure protection through the establishment of a Cyber Excellence Mechanism.
* Improve national preparedness through assessments of security in selected critical infrastructure operators leading to the development of a Cyber Maturity Model.
* Perform large-scale tabletop exercises to test and reinforce developed response procedures to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
* Develop and support new degree programs in cybersecurity at higher education institutions.
* Provide immediate upskilling of current cybersecurity industry professionals.
* Build the capacity of security operations center analysts, system designers, risk managers, and auditors on topics that are relevant to their responsibilities.
* Create new and innovative approaches in cybersecurity, both proactively and in response to the government's needs for support to protect critical infrastructure entities from cyberattacks. 
* Raise awareness within government entities and among the private sector about cybersecurity threats and means of protection. 

### Select Results

* Supported the development and adoption of a new National Cybersecurity Strategy, formalized in a Presidential Decree in August 2021.
* Prepared the Roadmap for implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy and research on the cybersecurity workforce needs.  
* Provided technical advice during the drafting of a new Law on Critical Infrastructure. The Ukrainian Parliament adopted the law and the president signed it into law, laying out the parameters for managing critical infrastructure and mandates for further legislation, including the introduction of cyber insurance.
* Launched a Small and Medium Business Accelerator, “CyberAccelerator UA,” which provided more than 100 hours of training to 10 cybersecurity companies.
* Launched the Chief Technology Officer Peer Mentoring Program, which matched Ukrainian mentees and U.S. Chief Information Security Officer mentors and led to hundreds of hours of professional exchanges.
* Supported the establishment of a Cybersecurity Higher Education Program involving 14 universities representing 10 oblasts across the country. 
* Supported five universities to adopt computer science courses in their mainstream curricula, enrolling 368 students. The project developed and promoted the courses and will continue to facilitate partnerships with higher education institutions.
* Activated the RangeForce platform to provide hands-on training to up to 10,000 top students in cybersecurity concentrations. 
* Provided professional training to critical infrastructure operators and government employees for certification in globally recognized credentials, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Network Defender, and Certified Ethical Hacker. 
* Provided support to operationalize the UA30 Cyber Center under the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine, an important element in the framework of the country’s cybersecurity strategy. The center houses Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team as well as teams monitoring and analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities. The Activity provided branding and communications assistance to support the launch event attended by President Zelensky and Vice Prime Minister Fedorov.
