Ukraine is engaged in an ongoing hybrid, asymmetric, and kinetic struggle against cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s energy sectors—oil and gas, nuclear, electricity, and hydroelectric systems—are a particular target of cyber-aggression, as evidenced by the [2014 Sandworm attacks](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/russian-sandworm-hack-isight/). These attacks, and others, pose complex and novel challenges that require Ukraine to respond rapidly, deploy effective countermeasures, and build new defenses against future attacks from a range of potential internal and external malicious actors. The goal of this activity is to rapidly mature Ukraine’s cybersecurity posture and enable it to be a trusted source for solutions, services, and talent.  

### Sample Activities

* Create a cybersecurity research and training lab and support the ecosystem needed to provide and develop solutions that meet Ukrainian demand for cybersecurity products and services that also have global market potential.
* Work with the government to review existing or drafted cybersecurity legislation, policies, and strategies, and develop an approach for the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to create a national Cybersecurity Roadmap.
* Establish a communications and liaison office to increase stakeholder engagement and coordination.
* Perform large-scale tabletop exercises to test and reinforce developed response procedures to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
* Build the capacity of security operations center analysts, system designers, risk managers, and auditors on topics that are relevant to their responsibilities.

### Select Results

* Supported five universities to adopt computer science courses in their mainstream curricula, enrolling 368 students. The project developed and promoted the courses and will continue to facilities partnerships with higher education institutions.
* Supported supported the Ukraine National Security and Defense Council in the October 2021 international conference "Countering Cyber Threats in the Modern Security Environment." 
* Hosted a Certified Information Security Manager training covering establishing and maintaining an information security governance framework; managing information risk to an acceptable level based organizational goals and objectives; developing and maintaining an information security program that identifies, manages, and protects assets; and, developing the capability to detect, investigate, respond to and recover from information security incidents. 
* Provided support to operationalize the UA30 Cyber Center under the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine, an important element in the framework of the country's cybersecurity strategy.
