Ukraine is engaged in an ongoing hybrid, asymmetric, and kinetic struggle against cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s energy sectors—oil and gas, nuclear, electricity, and hydroelectric systems—are a particular target of cyber aggression. Hybrid warfare campaigns against Ukraine continue, with a marked increase in targeted spear-phishing campaigns against Government of Ukraine employees. 

These attacks, and others, pose complex and novel challenges that require Ukraine to respond rapidly, deploy effective countermeasures, and build new defenses against future attacks from a range of potential internal and external malicious actors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Activity works to strengthen the resilience of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure from cyberattacks by establishing trusted collaboration between key cybersecurity stakeholders in the government, private sector, academia, and civil society.

The activity contributes to improved cybersecurity in Ukraine. Increasing organizational and technical capacity in key institutions and ensuring that the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is prepared to take on these challenges are the activity’s priorities, as well as building the foundation for improved preparedness based on an effective legal regulatory framework, effective communication between stakeholders, and engagement with the private sector. In addition, the activity supports a secure digital transformation in Ukraine by providing testing of e-services and engaging a broader community of experts and testers. 

### Sample Activities

* With the government, review existing or drafted cybersecurity legislation, policies, and strategies, and develop an approach for the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to create a national Cybersecurity Roadmap.
* Build government capacity to implement key cybersecurity initiatives in critical infrastructure protection through the establishment of a Cyber Excellence Mechanism.
* Improve national preparedness through assessments of security in selected critical infrastructure operators leading to development of a Cyber Maturity Model.
•	Perform large-scale tabletop exercises to test and reinforce developed response procedures to cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.
•	Develop and support new degree programs in cybersecurity at higher education institutions
•	Provide immediate upskilling of current cybersecurity industry professionals.
•	Build the capacity of security operations center analysts, system designers, risk managers, and auditors on topics that are relevant to their responsibilities.
•	Create new and innovative approaches in cybersecurity, both proactively and in response to Government of Ukraine needs for support to protect critical infrastructure entities from cyberattacks. 
•	Raise awareness within the Government of Ukraine entities and among the private sector about cybersecurity threats and means of protection. 


### Select Results
