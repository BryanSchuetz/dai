In the same way that cyberattacks drove Estonia to innovate cybersecurity practices, systems, and entrepreneurship—innovation that ultimately became the backbone of its digital transformation—DAI will leverage Ukraine’s unique position as a testbed of Russian cyberattacks into an opportunity to innovate solutions that transform Ukraine from a compromised, reactive cybersecurity actor to a proactive cybersecurity leader. The activity will strengthen Ukraine’s long-term cyber resilience through mutually reinforcing activities addressing legal, policy, institutional, workforce, and market gaps.
DAI’s subcontractors on this project are Catalisto, Florida International University, Information Systems Security Partners, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Veterans First Initiative, and SocialBoost.
USAID’s first-ever bilateral cybersecurity project, the Ukraine Cybersecurity activity is the leading edge of a fast-growing new technical sector for the Agency that DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration identified as a strategic priority starting in 2018. Thanks to everyone involved in that work and to everyone who contributed to this award, which is the culmination of more than a year of intense collaboration under the Broad Agency Announcement co-creation process.
