Tahseen, which means “improvement” in Arabic, supports the systems and procedures necessary to operationalize and accelerate Government of Tunisia reforms that are modernizing the system for managing public revenues and expenditures.

Tahseen complements other activities by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Tunisia by supporting the Ministry of Finance’s plan for an enhanced public financial management information system that increases the efficiency, transparency, and predictability of public finances, and strengthens the ministry’s capacity to carry out fiscal, budgetary, and revenue collection mandates. The project is also advancing digital solutions to optimize regulations, procedures, and authorizations that reduce the cost and time burden on businesses, facilitate investment and trade, and promote innovation. 

Finally, Tahseen works to strengthen communications between policy makers and the public to build a common understanding of the constraints to—and opportunities for—economic expansion. Combining key investment and business reforms with associated e-service platforms that spur equitable economic growth, Tahseen represents an important opportunity to assist the Government of Tunisia in financing its journey to self-reliance.
