The Government of Guatemala’s anemic ratio of tax revenue-to-gross domestic product means the country cannot afford to provide critical public services. The Fiscal and Procurement Reform Project (FPRP) supports the government to increase domestic resource mobilization, enhance transparency and accountability, and support public procurement reform. 

Through FPRP, DAI works with Guatemala’s Tax and Customs Administration and Ministry of Finance to collect and spend revenue with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, ultimately increasing its ability to invest in public services and improve outcomes for citizens in health, education, and economic growth.

The project draws from similar fiscal reform successes by DAI on behalf the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in El Salvador, Jordan, and the Philippines.

* Redesign public procurement software systems to increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency.
* Increase the utilization of Guatemalan small and medium-sized businesses in government procurement.

## Select Results
