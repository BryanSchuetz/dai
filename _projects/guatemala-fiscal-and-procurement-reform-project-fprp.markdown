The Government of Guatemala’s anemic ratio of tax revenue-to-gross domestic product means the country cannot afford to provide critical public services. The project team will assist the government to increase domestic resource mobilization, enhance transparency and accountability, and support public procurement reform. 

Through FPRP, DAI will assist Guatemala’s Tax and Customs Administration and Ministry of Finance to collect and spend revenue with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, ultimately increasing its ability to invest in public services and improve outcomes for citizens in health, education, and economic growth.

This project will draw from similar fiscal reform successes by DAI on behalf the U.S. Agency for International Development in El Salvador, Jordan, and the Philippines.    

## Sample Activities

* Support the *Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria* (Tax and Customs Administration) in optimizing business processes, modernizing systems, and strengthening newly created offices for taxpayer assistance, fiscal investigation, and personnel training.

* Redesign public procurement software systems to increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

* Increase the utilization of Guatemalan small and medium-sized businesses in government procurement. 

* Strengthen the Directorate for Public Procurement to serve as an oversight body.
