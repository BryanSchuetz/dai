The Tangier-Tétouan-Al Hoceima (TTAH) in Northern Morocco has historically been a marginalised region, not benefitting from the nationwide growth Morocco has experienced over the past two decades. As a result, a burgeoning sense of disenchantment with political processes and heightened social tensions have developed throughout the region.

In the years leading to and following King Mohammed IV’s constitutional reforms in 2011, the Kingdom of Morocco has demonstrated a commitment to decentralisation, local participation and enhanced service delivery. Under Morocco’s Advanced Regionalisation agenda, the government aims to adopt a decentralised administrative structure, devolving policy making to locally elected governments and incentivising active civic participation. 
The United Kingdom is supporting this ongoing reform process and to this end, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched the TASHAROC project to strengthen political representation and citizen engagement in the TTAH region. 

In partnership with the TTAH Regional Council (RC) and working closely with the regional development agency AREP, other regional stakeholders and civil society actors, TASHAROC undertakes a range of technical assistance activities to build the capability, accountability and responsiveness of the RC and AREP. The TASHAROC team has additionally provided support to the region’s legally mandated Consultative Bodies (CBs) and a range of civil society organisations (CSOs). Much of this work is done through support to the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of regional development projects as defined by TTAH’s Plan de Développement Regional (PDR). 

TASHAROC thereby works to support inclusive development and reduce political and economic disenfranchisement in the Northern Moroccan region.
