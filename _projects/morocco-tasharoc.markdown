Morocco’s northern region of Tangier-Tétouan-Al Hoceima (TTAH) has been historically isolated from and marginalised by the central government. Despite recent investments in industry and infrastructure, most of the region’s population remains excluded from the benefits of economic growth and participatory democracy. As a result, a broad distrust of political processes and heightened social tensions have developed in TTAH.  

Following recent constitutional reforms and a renewed regionalisation agenda in Morocco, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched the TASHAROC project to strengthen political representation and citizen engagement in the TTAH region. The project provides technical assistance to regional government and civil society actors to promote inclusive development and reduce political marginalisation and economic disenfranchisement in the region.
