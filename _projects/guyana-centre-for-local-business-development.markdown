The Sustainable Business Group (SBG) designed a [Centre for Local Business Development](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-to-collaborate-with-exxonmobil-on-centre-for-local-business-development-in-guyana) in Guyana to provide business training, mentorship, embedded technical advisors, industry information, and analysis to help link local suppliers with oil and gas supply chain opportunities. The Centre conducts market analysis and gap studies of local suppliers to design upgrading plans to meet international standards. 

Additionally, the Centre offers advisory services and trainings on business process management, the oil and gas industry, safety, health and the environment and international standards. The Centre links with local training institutes to provide information on labor requirements, supply chain standards and certifications needed to train up local staff to participate in the new oil and gas industry.
