The first phase of the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) in Kenya—from 2009 to 2012—reached 69,000 households in four northern counties with a cash transfer payment every two months. Phase 2 expands coverage within the same four counties: Marsabit, Mandera, [Turkana][1], and Wajir.

Households receiving the regular bi-monthly cash transfers have been selected from the poorest 10 percent in each county, using a combination of Community-Based Targeting and Proxy Means Testing. The number of beneficiary households will gradually increase to 100,000. A scalable emergency cash transfer response to droughts will be built for 470,000 households, which will be provided with bank accounts and cards in advance to facilitate rapid transfers.

The goal of [HSNP2][2] is to continue to reduce poverty, hunger, and vulnerability in the focus counties, resulting in better and more sustainable [safety nets][3] for poor and [vulnerable households][4].
