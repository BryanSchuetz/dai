The Egypt Economic Governance Activity (EGA) works with the Government of Egypt to support the country’s investment climate by strengthening inclusive governance and supporting the Government’s structural reform program.
 
EGA supports Egypt’s economic and good governance reforms by:
 
* Supporting the reform process.
* Building capacity in public administration, including rolling out anticorruption training across the government at all levels of the civil service.
* Improving local service delivery, with an emphasis on innovative e-governance. 
 
Together, these efforts should increase participation and inclusion in Egypt’s governance reforms, enhance the transparency and accountability of government services, improve government effectiveness, and combat corruption—all of which will boost Egypt’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. DAI’s “sustainable reform” approach to EGA promotes multilevel sustainability by applying a nuanced understanding of the political economy and a management stance that supports government actors from behind the scenes.
