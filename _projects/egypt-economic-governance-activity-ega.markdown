Tthe Egypt Economic Governance Activity (EGA), a task order under the Public Financial Management II IDIQ. EGA will work with USAID/Egypt and the Government of Egypt to support the country’s  investment climate by strengthening inclusive governance and supporting the Government’s structural reform program.
 
This exciting cross-sector engagement will support Egypt’s economic and good governance reforms by:
 
Supporting the reform process;
Building capacity in public administration, including rolling out anticorruption training across the government at all levels of the civil service; and
Improving local service delivery, with an emphasis on innovative e-governance. 
 
Together, these efforts should increase participation and inclusion in Egypt’s governance reforms, enhance the transparency and accountability of government services, improve government effectiveness, and combat corruption—all of which will boost Egypt’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. DAI’s “sustainable reform” approach to EGA promotes multilevel sustainability by applying a nuanced understanding of the political economy and a management stance that supports government actors from behind the scenes.
 
Our subcontractors are Finance and Banking Consultants International (FinBi); the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs’ Picker School of Executive Education; and Baseera, the Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research.
 
With this award, DAI will now implement projects for the Mission’s Democracy and Governance and its Economic Growth offices—EGA will continue and complement DAI’s work with the Ministry of Planning, a relationship central to the Macro-Economic Stabilization and Reform (MESR) project. This win is an excellent example of how relationships of trust built with in-country counterparts and with USAID are central to our value proposition. Thanks and congratulations to everyone who contributed to the win.
