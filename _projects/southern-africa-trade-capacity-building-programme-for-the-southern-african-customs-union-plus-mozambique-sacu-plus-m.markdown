We are delighted to report that DAI will provide management and technical services to the FCO in support of the Trade Capacity Building Programme for the Southern African Customs Union + Mozambique (SACU+M). 
 
SACU+M will provide technical assistance to support growth in trade, improve gender equality in the trade arena, and alleviate poverty across Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and South Africa, with a focus on:
 
	Increasing access to information and promoting trade;
	Supporting compliance with market standards and better integrating value chains;
	Providing and improving access to training in trade and customs; and
	Promoting equality for women in trade.
 
The programme is intended to increase opportunities to trade, overcome nontechnical barriers to trade in goods, and improve export performance in the region, while facilitating trade between SACU+M and the United Kingdom as it exits the European Union.
 
Mark Walter is the programme’s inception phase leader.
 
Thanks and congratulations to everyone involved in securing this latest addition to our growing FCO portfolio.
