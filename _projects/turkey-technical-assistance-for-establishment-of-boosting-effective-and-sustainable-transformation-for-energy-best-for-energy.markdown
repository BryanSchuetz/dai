In recent years, energy consumption in Türkiye has grown rapidly, due to urbanization, positive demographic trends, economic growth, and increasing per capita income. But the country remains dependent on imported sources of energy, which can experience price fluctuations. Improving energy security is, therefore, one of Türkiye's top priorities. 

The [Technical Assistance Project for Establishment of Boosting Effective and Sustainable Transformation for Energy](https://www.bestforenergy.org/homepage) (BEST for Energy) will increase the use of alternative energy sources, including renewable sources. The project also supports Türkiye's renewable energy industry and services to become more internationally competitive. 

BEST for Energy focuses on the city of İzmir—and its vicinity—to ensure strong clustering in the renewable energy sector, which is essential to stimulating a long-term and self-sufficient enabling environment. The project's activities contribute to İzmir’s regional renewable energy service and equipment industry cluster by increasing the competitiveness of its value chain, in line with the Competitiveness and Innovation Sector Operational Programme in Türkiye. 

## Sample Activities

* Preparing a development strategy and action plan for Izmir's renewable energy services and equipment cluster.
* Promoting the renewable energy service and equipment cluster.
* Creating capacity-building activities for cluster organizations, the Izmir Development Agency, and stakeholders.
