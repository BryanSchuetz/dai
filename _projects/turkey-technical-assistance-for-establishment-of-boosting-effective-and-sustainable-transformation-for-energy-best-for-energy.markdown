Energy consumption in Turkey has rapidly grown especially in recent years due to the pace of urbanization, positive demographic trends, economic growth and increasing per capita income. On the other hand, Turkey’s import dependency of energy along with the price fluctuations of these imports make energy security one of the top priorities of the country. 

The DAI implemented technical assistance project for Establishment of BEST for Energy (Boosting Effective and Sustainable Transformation for Energy) will increase the use of alternative energy sources in the overall energy mix such as renewable energy sources as well as supporting the international competitiveness of the renewable energy industry and services. The project will focus on the city of İzmir and its vicinity to ensure the strong clustering in the renewable energy sector, which is essential to stimulating a long-term and self-sufficient development of an enabling environment for the renewable energy sector.

All the activities under this project will contribute to the different elements and systems of İzmir’s regional renewable energy service and equipment industry cluster by increasing competitiveness of its value chain, in line with the Competitiveness and Innovation Sector Operational Programme (CISOP) in Turkey. 

### Sample Activities

* Prepare a development strategy and action plan for renewable energy services and equipment cluster.
* Promote the renewable energy service and equipment cluster.
* Create capacity building activities for cluster organizations, the Izmir Development Agency, and stakeholders.
