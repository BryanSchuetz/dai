In recent years, energy consumption in Turkey has grown rapidly, due to urbanization, positive demographic trends, economic growth, and increasing per capita income. But the country remains dependent on imported sources of energy, which can experience price fluctuations. Improving energy security is, therefore, one of Turkey's top priorities. 

The Technical Assistance Project for Establishment of Boosting Effective and Sustainable Transformation for Energy (BEST for Energy) will increase the use of alternative energy sources, including renewable sources. The project also Turkey's renewable energy industry and services to become more internationally competitive. BEST for Energy focuses on the city of İzmir—and its vicinity—to ensure strong clustering in the renewable energy sector, which is essential to stimulating a long-term and self-sufficient  enabling environment.

All the activities under this project contribute to the different elements and systems of İzmir’s regional renewable energy service and equipment industry cluster by increasing competitiveness of its value chain, in line with the Competitiveness and Innovation Sector Operational Programme in Turkey. 

### Sample Activities

* Prepare a development strategy and action plan for renewable energy services and equipment cluster.
* Promote the renewable energy service and equipment cluster.
* Create capacity building activities for cluster organizations, the Izmir Development Agency, and stakeholders.
