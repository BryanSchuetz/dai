In the past decade, Tanzania experienced significant improvements both economically and socially. The country’s gross domestic product has seen above-average growth; under-five childhood mortality has dropped substantially; more households have electricity; and more young people than ever have completed primary school. However, economic growth has benefited cities more than rural areas, leading to increased rural to urban migration by youth who see farming as a dead-end occupation. With approximately 800,000 young people entering the workforce each year, providing youth with vocational skills and connecting them to employment opportunities has become an increasingly important and urgent need. In addition, young women in particular have been negatively affected by higher levels of sexual and gender-based violence and a rise in teenage pregnancy.

To help empower Tanzanian youth to respond to these challenges, the Future Entrepreneurs and Leaders (FuEL) activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is building the capacities of young people ages 15-29 to enhance their employability, business savvy, leadership skills, and participation in civic life. FuEL also works to improve the ability of youth to use health information and services to make informed choices for healthier futures. Taking a youth-centered approach, FuEL engages young people as collaborators and leaders in program design and implementation, while also fostering public-private partnerships to build a stronger enabling environment for youth-focused job creation.
