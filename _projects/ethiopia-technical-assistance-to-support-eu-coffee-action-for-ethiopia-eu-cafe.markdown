The Ethiopian Coffee and Authority (ECTA) has been implementing various coffee production, processing and marketing activities to enhance the sustainability of the national economy and for the improvement of the wellbeing of small holder farmer including women and youth. Low coffee production, poor quality and marketing are some of the major challenges contributing to low returns to farmers and poor foreign exchange earnings to the country from the coffee sector. In response to addressing the above mentioned challenges, the Authority proposed and signed the financial agreement with European Union - Coffee Action for Ethiopia (EU-CAfE). 
The DAI-led technical assistance project to Support EU-Coffee Action for Ethiopia (EU-CafE) has been initiated to sustainably improve farmers’ access to inputs including coffee seed and seedlings, appropriate coffee production techniques, timely and farmer focused extension and advisory services and capacity of farmers through organizing Farmers Field School extension approach.  Additionally, the project aims to support smallholder Ethiopian coffee producers, processors, traders & their organizations to improve productivity and quality with a focus on specialty and traceability of coffees, value chain development, and trade transparency through public-private partnerships and dialogue platforms.
