Despite recent reforms in legislation, policy, and practice, many Pakistanis have little trust in law enforcement or justice institutions that they perceive as widely corrupt, slow, and ineffective. Lack of awareness of both how justice institutions function and the confidence to approach them is particularly common among poor and marginalized populations as well as minorities and women, often leading them to turn to informal and non-state means of justice. On the institutional side, lawyers are reluctant to represent defendants accused of certain crimes, such as blasphemy, while judges can be unwilling to make rulings that contradict the status quo. However, an interest in reform is emerging, including new women’s rights initiatives from the Ministry of Law and Justice and the passage of progressive legislation such as the Punjab Protection of Women Bill. Along with high-profile support from key judicial and parliamentary leaders for stronger legal institutions, these actions represent a shift towards a more democratic rule of law across Pakistan.

To build upon this positive momentum for change, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) has launched the Accountable Justice in Pakistan Programme (AJPP) to effect tangible and significant improvements in the application of the rule of law in Pakistan. By equipping Pakistani men, women, and youth with the knowledge and capacity to hold key law enforcement and justice sector institutions to account, AJPP will increase citizen engagement in legal reforms and legal empowerment, leading to more equitable and effective justice systems for all.

DAI’s three-pronged strategy for AJPP–utilizing a citizen-centered approach, demand-led management methodology, and a political awareness of threats and opportunities for reform–will provide the flexibility and feedback loops needed to address the complex barriers to change. Through a set of well-coordinated interventions, AJPP will work to disrupt the damaging cycle in which citizens’ lack of knowledge on how to access the judicial institutions and hold them to account results in poor performance, further feeding criminal impunity and reliance on informal means of justice.
