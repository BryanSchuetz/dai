Among the first acts of Libya’s revolutionary government in November 2011 was to create a Ministry of Local Government, a first step in fulfilling the people’s commitment to *la markaziyya,* or decentralization, a core value of the revolution, seen as insurance against the emergence of another brutal and totalizing dictatorship. In June 2012 Libya’s National Transitional Council approved Law 59, which outlined an audacious plan for fiscal and administrative governance at the municipal level. Though a lack of governing capacity and much political turmoil since 2011 has interrupted the comprehensive realization of Libya’s vision for local governance, a deep commitment to that vision remains.  Moreover, substantial efforts to re-start the process of fiscal and administrative decentralization in summer 2019 suggest that there is now a unique opportunity for USAID to work with Libyans in building a effective model of democratic self-rule, one that is grounded in the fundamental relationship between citizens and their local governments.

Taqarib strengthens the foundation of a more unified Libyan state by empowering local governments, reinforcing community bonds, and improving people’s standard of living. Taqarib helps citizens engage in public dialogue, prioritize public resource allocations, and understand the roles and responsibilities of local government. The project links enhancements to service delivery at the municipal level with national efforts to improve the execution of decentralization policy, and with efforts to undertake evidence-based reform.
