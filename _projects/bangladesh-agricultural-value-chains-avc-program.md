DAI is applying a [market systems approach](http://dai.com/news-publications/news/new-primer-market-systems-development-available) to agricultural value chains in Bangladesh’s Southern Delta, home to 30 million people where poverty and under-nutrition are acute and persistent, agricultural productivity is low, and farmers are not linked to markets.

Funded under the Feed the Future initiative, this project works is strengthening 10 agricultural value chains through a [range](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/market-systems-development-boosts-farming-nutrition-in-bangladeshs-southern-delta/) of tools, platforms, and agreements to implement large-scale, systemic interventions. We have forged agreements with 25 of the most influential private sector firms and organizations in the agricultural sector; through these agreements, AVC is leveraging private sector interests and investment opportunities to drive more inclusive growth.

Ultimately, AVC’s work will result in increased access to and availability of diverse and nutritious fruits, vegetables, and pulses in local, regional, and national markets and will contribute significantly to improving food security in the Southern Delta.

* Reached 74,000 new farmers in the third year of the project, a 393 percent increase over the second year.

* Introduced high-yielding and disease-resistant variety of nutritious mung bean, leading to a 4 percent yield increase per hectare, reduction of post-harvest loss by 6 percent, and increase in average net income per farmer by $64, or 78 percent per hectare.

* Tomato crop interventions led to yield increase by 8 percent per hectare and average income per farmer by 11 percent.
  Line-sowing techniques for cultivation of groundnuts plus fertilizer management resulted yield increase per hectare by 196 percent.

* Linked safe mango growers to two private sector enterprises; assisted those enterprises to develop a sustainable supply and marketing channel for safe mango through a local supermarket and local e-commerce platform, availing urban consumers of 500 metrics tons of graded premium quality mangoes.
