The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Western Kenya Water Project (WKWP) supports decentralized county governments to deliver basic drinking water services to 500,000 Kenyans and improve water service quality for 350,000 Kenyans.
 
The project will work across eight counties in Western Kenya (Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Siaya, Homa Bay, Kisii, Kisumu, and Migori) and with Lake Victoria North and South Basins to advance water security in the region. Our approach—dubbed Kenya Inatimiza (Kenya Delivers)—calls for solutions co-created and co-designed with each of the counties, depending on their baseline needs, priorities, and potential.
 
WKWP will feature a Solution Fund and emphasize data and technology, collaboration with the private sector, and engagement of Kenyan Resource Partners. Our subcontractors include the Centre for Social Planning and Administrative Development (CESPAD), a Kenyan NGO and new partner to USAID. CESPAD specializes in integrated water resources management, with a focus on capacity development, social accountability, public finance management, and qualitative and quantitative research to influence public policy and community development.
