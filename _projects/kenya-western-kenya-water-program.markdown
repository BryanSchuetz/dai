The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Western Kenya Water Project (WKWP) supports decentralized county governments to deliver basic drinking water services to 500,000 Kenyans and improve water service quality for 350,000 Kenyans.
 
The project works across eight counties in Western Kenya (Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Siaya, Homa Bay, Kisii, Kisumu, and Migori) and with Lake Victoria North and South Basins to advance water security in the region. Our approach—dubbed Kenya *Inatimiza* (Kenya Delivers)—calls for solutions co-created and co-designed with each of the counties, depending on their baseline needs, priorities, and potential. The program draws together the different components critical to countywide sustained service delivery—urban and rural water services, water resources management, and the good governance and financing strategies that help a sector to grow and satisfy customers. 
 
WKWP features a Solution Fund and emphasizes data and technology, collaboration with the private sector, and engagement of Kenyan resource partners.
