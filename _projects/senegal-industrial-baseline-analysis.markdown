DAI’s Sustainable Business Group conducted an industrial baseline assessment in Senegal using its proprietary [Local Content Optimization Model](https://www.dai.com/our-work/local-content-optimization-model) (LCOM) platform. The assessment provided a breakdown of the client’s expected spending across selected supply chain categories by conducting surveys with local goods and service suppliers. The survey results were mapped to a demand breakdown to forecast total local content needs and identify supply chain categories with high potential to be sourced locally.

The LCOM provided insights on how the client could procure good and services in a way that also benefits the Senegalese economy. Deliverables included a full report and analysis of the data as well as tendering (contracting) documents for use with the client’s Tier 1 contractors.
