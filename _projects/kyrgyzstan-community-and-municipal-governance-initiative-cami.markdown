After emerging from ethnic conflict and political upheaval in 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic has experienced a period of renewed political stability and strengthening of public institutions. At the national level, the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches are now firmly established in a new constitution, and a competitive democratic system has taken root. However, weak accountability and pervasive corruption continue to detract from citizen confidence in government institutions and inhibit the successful movement toward decentralization of government services. Ultimately, the country’s democratic reforms will not be sustainable until its citizens begin to experience them in their daily lives though an increased voice, improved services, and a stronger feeling of connectedness with their government.

The Community and Municipal Governance Initiative (CAMI) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, will support the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to strengthen this vital relationship between local governing bodies and the public they serve. CAMI will work with up to 50 municipal governments to help them more effectively respond to citizens’ needs and deliver services, thereby strengthening trust in government institutions and fortifying the Kyrgyz Republic’s recent democratic gains. 
 
DAI’s approach will focus first on service delivery improvements that are highly visible to the public with immediate positive impacts, such as solid waste management, water, lighting, transportation, and local economic development, while concurrently building the capacity of partner local governments across all service areas for which they are responsible.

### Sample Activities

* Work with local governments to develop effective public outreach strategies that address key citizen grievances identified in an initial rapid survey. 
* Support locally elected council members through trainings on topics such as conducting public hearings and budget and planning oversight.
* Assist in developing and disseminating a local council member code of ethics. 
* Utilize mobile phone-based surveys to help local governments monitor citizen feedback; address concerns in a timely manner; and foster greater public participation in the delivery of government services.
