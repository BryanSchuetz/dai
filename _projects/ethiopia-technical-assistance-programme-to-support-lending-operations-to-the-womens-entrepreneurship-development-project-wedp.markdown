The development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a key role in Ethiopia’s drive to reach middle-income country status within the next decade, and women entrepreneurs are an important element of this growth equation. Currently, high minimum loan sizes and excessive collateral requirements restrict women’s access to loans from commercial banks, while microfinance institutions need greater support to enhance their potential for long-term sustainability and growth.

In 2012, the Government of Ethiopia and the World Bank launched the Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Project, a component of the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development-funded Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia project. Since that time, WEDP has provided loans and business development services to over 15,000 women entrepreneurs in 10 urban centres in Ethiopia. The Technical Assistance Programme to Support Lending Operations to the Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) further works to reduce unemployment in Ethiopia by offering women improved access to a diverse and responsible range of financial products aimed at encouraging income generation and business growth.

Our technical assistance team will provide capacity building and technical assistance to partner Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and ensure that WEDP funds are deployed in an efficient, responsible and sustainable manner, in accordance with the EIB’s and WEDP standards and requirements.

Sample Activities:

- Understand the success factors and constraints of WEDP loan disbursement,

- Provide tailor-made technical assistance to WEDP actors and for new MFIs: refresher training, capacity building, needs assessment, Financial and social performance indicator reports,

- Ensure DBE compliance with EIB requirements,

- Establish local source of TA support for WEDP MFIs,

- Develop a monitoring and Evaluation database.
