Lebanese agricultural products have the potential to compete well in regional and international markets; however many products require improvements in terms of quality and specifications to meet customer demand, leveraging the country's significant assets and abundant talented human resources. In addition, the country is affected by the regional crisis, particularly in rural areas. The Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) project is a five-year, $41.7 million U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program aimed at improving Lebanon's economic stability and providing income-generating opportunities for small business while creating jobs for the rural population, in particular women and youth. LIVCD aims to [improve the competitiveness and value of products](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/despite-regional-instability-lebanons-honey-sector-reaches-new-heights/?utm_source=daidotcom) and services in both local and export markets by increasing the quality, quantity, and consistency of Lebanese products and companies.
