This project catalyzes inclusive, sustainable economic growth in a potentially highly productive agricultural area in Haiti. As the flagship Feed the Future program in the region, it is positioned to be one of the most innovative initiatives by increasing incomes while also developing local companies into direct partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s assistance to Haiti.

The project's objectives include: increasing agricultural productivity among a wider circle of small farmers; improving watershed stability above selected plains; strengthening agricultural markets by increasing access to financial products; and improving transportation infrastructure such as roads to fertile but inaccessible farmland.

###  Sample Activities

* Introduce higher-yielding crop varieties and cultivation techniques in five strategic crops (rice, bananas, beans, maize, and cacao) to 43,000 targeted beneficiaries in six watersheds in northern Haiti.
* Pilot a voucher program to increase beneficiaries' access to agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides while stimulating local markets for these commodities.
* Ensure access to best practices and approaches that improve product quality and producer efficiency.
* Embrace local ownership and sustainability while emphasizing quality assurance, quality control, and effective return on investment.
* Train and support local organizations to strengthen their systems and make them eligible for direct support from USAID.
* Leverage local breakthroughs in mobile money and market information systems; integrate new technology throughout all interventions.
* Analyze and integrate gender considerations, ensuring that women and men benefit equally from AVANSE interventions. All project indicators are disaggregated for gender.
* Conduct environmental assessments in six watersheds to ensure compliance with Haiti's Code of Federal Regulations and an understanding of the delicate nature of the watersheds and dangers of mismanagement.

###  Select Results

* In the project's first year, [7,007 farmers][2] were trained to apply new agricultural technologies.
* Nearly 5,000 rural households benefitted directly from the project.
