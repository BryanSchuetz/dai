Smallholder land registrations under the Village Land Act in Tanzania are critical to protecting local land rights. However, since passing the Village Act in 1999, the process of registration has moved slowly, primarily due to operational capacity limitations. Procedures for bringing the law into effect need to be low-cost, simple, efficient, and equitable. In addition, the land registration system must support future transactions and allow registers to be maintained at village and district levels. 

Under the Land Tenure Assistance (LTA) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), DAI is modifying an existing tool for mapping smallholdings and detailing ownership claims—Mobile Application to Secure Tenure (MAST)–which USAID first piloted in Tanzania. This tool will be linked to a low-cost land registry tool, the Technical Register Under Social Tenure (TRUST), that DAI is developing at the district level, with plans to scale up to other areas of the country. The outcome is a low-cost, participatory land registration process that is [transforming the way](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/frontlines/may-june-2017/rural-tanzanians-map-their-countrys-future) land rights are managed in Tanzania, with the potential for adaptation elsewhere.

### Sample Activities

* Assist villages and district administration in understanding the Village Land Act, completing the land-use planning process, and delivering Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy.

* Support capacity building of village and district land governance institutions.

* Expand programs to educate and build capacity of village land governance institutions and of district-level land governance.

* Building capacity to use the MAST application throughout Tanzania.

### Select Results

* Designed and developed formal field and office operations and procedures for regularising land ownership, with a view to registering land in more than 40 villages by December 2019. This process is being implemented in the districts of Iringa and Mbeya.

* Completed demarcation of 32,000 parcels in  in 22 villages and issued 22,000 Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy.

* Nearly 50 percent of claimants are [women](https://www.usaid.gov/results-data/success-stories/land-rights-mark-new-frontier-rural-women), who hold land in multiple plots either singly, [jointly](https://land-links.org/document/lta-success-story-land-registration-opens-economic-doors-women-kiponzelo/), or in common. Analysis of incoming data is ongoing to ensure rights of women and vulnerable groups are secured.
