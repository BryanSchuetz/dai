The positive economic impacts for countries joining the European Union (EU) are well documented. The Advancing Commerce Connectivity and Exports Leading to Economic Readiness for Accession to the EU (ACCELERATE) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, works to advance EU market integration and support the accession of up to 12 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, and countries across the Western Balkans and the Caucasus. 
 
ACCELERATE works with countries to help them meet the economic, governance, and political criteria associated with accession and by addressing common economic constraints to accession on a regional basis (that is, tackling issues involving at least two countries from the Europe and Eurasia region). It also advances Euro-Atlantic integration in non-accession countries. 
 
Our work addresses issues such as trade facilitation, access to finance, compliance with EU standards and obligations (for both public and private entities), investment transparency, public financial management, and anti-corruption measures.
  
Through our leadership, networks, localized structure, and technical experience, the DAI-led consortium drives the change needed to achieve ACCELERATE’s objectives.
