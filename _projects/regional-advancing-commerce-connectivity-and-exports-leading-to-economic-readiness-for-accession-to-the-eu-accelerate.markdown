The Advancing Commerce Connectivity and Exports Leading to Economic Readiness for Accession to the EU (ACCELERATE) program is a regional buy-in mechanism is designed to advance European Union (EU) market integration and support the EU accession of up to 12 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, and countries across the Western Balkans and the Caucasus. 
 
The positive economic impacts for countries joining the EU are well documented. ACCELERATE facilitates this process by working with countries to help them meet the economic, governance, and political criteria associated with accession and by addressing common economic constraints to accession on a regional basis (that is, tackling issues involving at least two countries from the Europe and Eurasia region). It will also advance Euro-Atlantic integration in non-accession countries. 
 
Our work addresses issues such as trade facilitation, access to finance, compliance with EU standards and obligations (for both public and private entities), investment transparency, public financial management, and anticorruption.
  
ACCELERATE underscores the U.S. commitment to the prosperity and stability of its European partners at a crucial time for a region facing increasing Russian belligerence.
