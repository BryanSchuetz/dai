Though Ethiopia has achieved dramatic increases in economic growth and some successes in reducing poverty rates, the country's challenges remain substantial; gross domestic product (GDP) per capita continues to be one of the lowest in the world, revenue collection lags behind growth rates, and incentives for private sector growth are limited. Public sector reform is challenging and the goals of the National Growth and Transformation Plan are ambitious. Success is only possible when reform is closely adapted to the local political and economic context, is well sequenced, and is Ethiopian-led.

The Tax, Audit, and Transparency Programme (TAUT) supports the Government of Ethiopia in progressively expanding the tax base and ensuring more effective tax administration. TAUT works to improve the business climate and public oversight and transparency across specific government agencies and the wider public sector.

TAUT monitors evidence that key agencies are expanding their reach and improving their effectiveness, ensuring improved revenue mobilization and more transparent and accountable services to Ethiopians.

###  Sample Activities
