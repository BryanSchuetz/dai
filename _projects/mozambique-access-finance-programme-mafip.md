The Mozambique Access to Finance Programme (MAFiP) facilitates financial inclusion for all through a range of quality financial services to more than 2 million poor Mozambicans and 650 businesses, particularly in rural areas. The project also helps drive finance for stability by promoting the development and implementation of strong financial sector regulation, supervision, and infrastructure to promote and maintain Mozambique's favorable economic and social conditions domestically and internationally.

###  Sample Activities

* Support mechanisms to improve financial capability among micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), and households to engage with financial institutions.
* Support the development of financial infrastructure to enable financial institutions to broaden and deepen financial services offered.
* Collaborate with the Government of Mozambique to drive through policy and regulatory changes designed to improving access to finance for low-income households and MSMEs.
* Facilitate the development of innovative new products and delivery channels that link to Mozambique's growth sectors and that better serve Mozambique's marginalized populations.
