The Mozambique Local Governance Strengthening (LOGOS) project supports the Government of the Republic of Mozambique’s efforts to decentralize governance and thereby improve delivery of public services at central, provincial, district, and/or municipal levels.
 
LOGOS engages with subnational government entities to strengthen their effectiveness, transparency, and accountability; and to improve service delivery in health, education, and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors in targeted geographic areas. 

## Sample Activities
 
* Strengthen economic governance of targeted Mozambican institutions.
* Build the service delivery capacity of targeted subnational governments.
* Accelerate resilient, broad-based economic growth in targeted subnational territories.
