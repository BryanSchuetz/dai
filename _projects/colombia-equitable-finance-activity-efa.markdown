The Colombia Equitable Finance Activity (EFA) partners with underserved populations, the financial services sector, and the Government of Colombia to address the demand, supply, and enabling environment constraints that limit access to formal financial services for rural and conflict-affected Colombians. 
 
On the demand side, EFA improves the financial and digital capabilities of individuals and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to bolster economic activity and social stability, drive financial product uptake and customer performance, and increase household income and assets.
 
On the supply side, EFA partners with the full range of Colombian financial services providers to design and deploy conventional and digital formal financial services that cater to the specific requirements of underserved communities.
 
For the enabling environment, EFA works to enhance the availability of actionable data on the financial lives of underserved communities and on the broader regulatory environment for financial inclusion.

In line with the U.S. Agency for International Development's Regional Integration Strategy, EFA prioritizes five economic corridors of Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial (PDET) municipalities, representing areas most affected by the conflict and home to 3 million Colombians.
