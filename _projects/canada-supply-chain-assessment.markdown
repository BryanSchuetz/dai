In 2019, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) completed a study to assess the global competitiveness of 14 Nova Scotian companies that provide marine works and engineering, testing, and inspection services to the offshore energy industry. In a follow-on study, SBG completed a supply chain assessment to determine if the targeted companies received value from the competitiveness assessment survey and provided guidance on strategies in response to the survey results. The new study also revealed what types  of provincial support are needed to upgrade the companies’ competitiveness and marketability in the energy industry.
