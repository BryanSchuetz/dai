Nigeria has significant security challenges and is confronted with instability and conflict on several fronts. The upcoming general elections in 2023 and in 2027 present a chance to improve the democratic process. 

The European Union-funded Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EUSDGN) Programme, Phase II, works to facilitate a peaceful and fair electoral process that advances the country’s political and economic development. 

DAI leads activities under Component 1 of the programme—Support to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)—which works to enhance the credibility of the elections and seeks to boost citizen participation across the country. Under the supervision of the EU Delegation, DAI also supports monitoring and evaluation and leads visibility activities for the project.
