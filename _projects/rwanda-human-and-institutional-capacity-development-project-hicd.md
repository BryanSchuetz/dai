Rwanda presents a compelling opportunity for Human and Institutional Capacity Development (HICD) implementation. As a regional leader in promoting aid effectiveness, Rwanda has received accolades for its clear and time-bound plans that define its development priorities. The Government of Rwanda (GOR) rightly recognizes that the country's capacity to implement these plans is pivotal to its ability to drive its own agenda.

To this end, DAI worked to strengthen institutional and human capacity in targeted GOR institutions, as well as in civil society organizations that work closely with or support the objectives of USAID/Rwanda. Our Performance for Development approach linked HICD outcomes directly to development impacts by: 1) advancing Rwandan Government development priorities, including stability, gender equity, and productive high-value and market-oriented agriculture; 2) supporting USAID/Rwanda development outcomes in technical sectors such as governance, food security, economic growth, health, and education; and 3) creating a demand for future HICD initiatives by linking HICD directly to results that matter to citizens.
