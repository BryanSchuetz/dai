Belarus has made significant progress towards reducing air pollution in the last decades. However, the air quality in the country is not complying with standards, and is often the cause of serious health impacts. 
One of the main goals of this project is to harmonise the relevant legislation in the fields of air quality monitoring and management and data collection systems. This project addresses the needs of the country toward improved air quality management and monitoring, aligning its environmental permitting regulations with international and EU standards. 
The intervention works towards supporting investments in natural capital and cleaner technologies to encourage low-carbon development and help to reduce adverse impacts on public health in Belarus.
