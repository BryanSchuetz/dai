summary: "Growth in the five East African Community Partner States—Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda—has been robust but uneven, with millions of people left behind in poverty.

Growth in the five East African Community Partner States—Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda—has been robust but uneven, with millions of people left behind in poverty. Women, youth, smallholder farmers, and the poor are not fully represented in policy making or implementation nor integrated into the wider economic community.

The [East Africa Trade and Investment Hub][1] is the U.S. Government's flagship project under the presidential Trade Africa initiative, which seeks to increase U.S.-Africa trade and investment, regional integration, and competitiveness. Managed by DAI, the Hub will assist the region's private sector to engage with government in finding practical solutions to constraints to [trade][2] and investment. The team will also build awareness around opportunities for African and U.S. firms to increase trade, expand business partnerships, and invest in East Africa.

###  Sample Activities

* Improve the policy environment for East African Community integration, trade, and investment.
* Bolster regional trade in staple foods.
* Improve information flows and promote the use of available global technology.
* Promote intra-regional trade and export trade, particularly under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
