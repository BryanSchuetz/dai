The Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund (AWEF) focused on market-system change and women’s economic empowerment in Egypt, Jordan, and until March 2018, the Occupied Palestinian Territories. AWEF developed an innovative and path-breaking approach to market systems to encourage the adoption of new practices and approaches to empower women. 

Women in the Middle East have untapped potential, they have the interest, skills, and ability to play a significantly more active role in the economy. It is only through long-term inclusion of women that these countries will be able to witness sustainable growth, security, and stability. AWEF aimed to change the way markets work by tackling critical underlying constraints that limited whether and how women participated in markets.

AWEF focused on catalysing change in the ready-made garments, citrus, public awareness, financial inclusion, dairy, market linkages, local government, and ICT/flexible work strategic areas, reaching 578,241 women through its interventions. More than 1,140 market actors and institutions adopted AWEF supported practices and 54 market actors and institutions demonstrated commitment to reform rules or internal policies that enabled and empowered women. AWEF helped to directly or indirectly facilitate 2,231 market linkages across Jordan, Egypt, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, generating increased income opportunities for women.  

AWEF generated additional income for 30,725 women and aggregated net additional income generated for poor women across Egypt and Jordan amounted to £4,630,204. 

Around 116,169 women benefited from increased productivity and/or skills. AWEF was a unique programme in that it worked to jointly improve women’s access to opportunities, but also empowered them to take hold of these opportunities by supporting their agency—their voice, choice, and decision making in economic spaces. AWEF interventions helped to strengthen voice, choice, and control for 75,107 women. 

AWEF [established a learning hub](https://seepnetwork.org/AWEF-Learning-Series) for women’s economic empowerment.

### Sample Activities

* Support businesses to increase the focus on women’s working conditions, including gender-sensitive recruitment, human resource management, and training policies in Egypt’s food retail, citrus, and ready-made garment sectors. 
* Assist[ home-based female producers](https://seepnetwork.org/Blog-Post/Discovering-A-Route-to-Formalize-Women-Owned-Businesses-in-Jordan) in Jordan’s dairy sector to raise awareness of the value of testing and certification of products to [increase their competitiveness](http://jordantimes.com/news/local/uk-project-helps-jerash-women-sell-dairy-products-national-market) and value.
* Work with government standards institutes, the private sector, and women producers of food products such as maftoul, cheese, and yoghurt to streamline certification processes and services and better enable women to move up the value chain.
* Support introduction of fee-based, [female paraveterinary services](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/turning-social-norms-in-the-middle-east-into-job-opportunities-for-women) to make basic animal health care services more available locally, particularly to home-based production run by women.

###  Select Results

* Worked with partners to expand the reach of digital financial services to women through networks of female agents in Egypt and Jordan. 
* Worked with digital financial service providers on financial literacy for women and adapting financial products to support women-owned microbusinesses. Following the success of the pilot, the partner worked to develop e-payment services to microfinance clients, reaching 100,027 women across Egypt. During COVID-19 restrictions on movement, these microbusinesses were able to continue making and receiving payments. 
* Influenced a formal change in the Palestinian Monetary Authority’s regulations on allowing banks to offer accounts for low-income earners. This change in position enables all low-income earners as well as those who are self-employed,  to access banking services and accounts which dramatically expands their potential market and improves women’s ability to make decisions over their own finances. 
•	Women’s Economic Empowerment Units- AWEF in Jordan worked with municipalities to introduce a platform within the municipality through which women have access to services that enable them to become more entrepreneurial and establish or formalise their businesses, such as training, information, networks and linkages to potential markets. 
•	Micro Entrepreneurship- in Jordan AWEF developed a suite of interventions supporting the growth of women owned home based businesses including establishing systems to generate market linkages between large retailers and women producers. 
•	In Jordan AWEF influenced a development of a guidelines on licensing of home-based businesses that was adopted by the Ministry of Local Administration. Licensing processes were institutionalised and implemented across 17 municipalities and had a significant impact on women’s sense of agency and engagement in local government, as well as increasing their ability to generate incomes. 
•	Supervisory Skills Training. In Egypt, AWEF worked with RMG factories to develop and institutionalise gender sensitive worker training to influence how businesses work with and perceive women in the workforce. 
•	Gender Sensitive Recruitment - AWEF worked with partners to develop and test new recruitment processes for women in the RMG sector. These new approaches included running women-only job fairs, creating mixed gender outreach teams as part of recruitment drives, and the adoption of gender-sensitive promotional materials.  As a result of this intervention 4,028 women were reached through recruitment events and AWEF’s partner and lead firm, Arafa established a reputation as a credible employer within targeted communities. 
•	Flexible Work – AWEF worked to change the mindset of large businesses to facilitate the reform of HR practises and the introduction of technology to allow women to work from home more flexibly. Lessons learnt from this were subsequently deployed by the business to facilitate a smooth transition to working from home during COVID-19 restrictions in Jordan. 





* [Launched a female agent network](https://seepnetwork.org/Resource-Post/Dinarak-Jordan-How-Mobile-Money-Can-Empower-Female-Agents-and-Clients) for digital financial services in Egypt and Jordan, leading to more than 34,000 additional female e-wallet users. Mobile money is a critical way for women to have greater control over their finances and be able to expand their businesses.
* Designed and developed a customised AWEF [Disadvantage Assessment Tool](https://seepnetwork.org/files/galleries/Disadvantage_Assessment_Brief_Revised_(Nov_2017).pdf), now in use in all three countries. 
* Set up a milk supply network of 189 to 250 women with a dairy processing company; it will be scaled to 500 women in the following year. 
* Supported 331 home-based dairy entrepreneurs in Jordan, generating higher incomes and contributing to positive perceptions of female-owned, home-based businesses.  
* Supported, in conjunction with 14 Jordanian Municipalities, the creation of Women’s Economic Empowerment Units, creating spaces within the local administration for women to learn about business registration, small business requirements, and to create linkages with other businesses for sale of products.
* Engaged with major Egyptian retailers to [increase the hiring](https://beamexchange.org/community/blogs/9999/1/1/fintech-for-women-egypt/) of women.
