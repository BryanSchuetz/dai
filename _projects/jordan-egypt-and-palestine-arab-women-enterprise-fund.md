Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and working in Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine, Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund (AWEF) was the first project of its kind. AWEF stimulated increased women’s economic empowerment through a [market systems approach][1]. This partnership addressed gaps in women’s economic empowerment in the region, which has one of the lowest rates of female labour force participation in the world. AWEF improved gender awareness and sensitivity across target companies’ human resources policies, increased employment and retention of women in the labour force, and raised awareness and uptake of standards and certification of products made by women working at home. AWEF tested innovative ways of working with the public and private sector to empower women and encourage them to more actively participate in markets and to support businesses be more inclusive of women. 

DAI was joined by subcontractors Market Share Associates, a global social enterprise focused on collaborative approaches to international development; Education for Employment, a nongovernmental organization working throughout the Middle East and North Africa; and Positive Planet International, a nongovernmental organization working to create the conditions for resilience and professional, cultural, and social sustainable development. 

AWEF reached 578,241 women across Egypt, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan through its interventions, facilitated the generation of £840,000 in additional income to women in Jordan, and helped 1,142 market actors adopt AWEF-supported practices.
