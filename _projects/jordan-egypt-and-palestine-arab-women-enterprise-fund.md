The Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund (AWEF) focused on market-system change and women’s economic empowerment in Egypt, Jordan, and until March 2018, the Occupied Palestinian Territories. AWEF developed an innovative and path-breaking approach to market systems to encourage the adoption of new practices and approaches to empower women. 

Women in the Middle East have untapped potential, they have the interest, skills, and ability to play a significantly more active role in the economy. It is only through long-term inclusion of women that these countries will be able to witness sustainable growth, security, and stability. AWEF aimed to change the way markets work by tackling critical underlying constraints that limited whether and how women participated in markets.

AWEF focused on catalysing change in the ready-made garments, citrus, public awareness, financial inclusion, dairy, market linkages, local government, and ICT/flexible work strategic areas, reaching 578,241 women through its interventions. More than 1,140 market actors and institutions adopted AWEF supported practices and 54 market actors and institutions demonstrated commitment to reform rules or internal policies that enabled and empowered women. AWEF helped to directly or indirectly facilitate 2,231 market linkages across Jordan, Egypt, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, generating increased income opportunities for women.  

AWEF has generated additional income for 30,725 women and aggregated net additional income generated for poor women across Egypt and Jordan amounted to £4,630,204. 

Around 116,169 women have benefited from increased productivity and/or skills. AWEF is a unique programme in that it has worked to jointly improve women’s access to opportunities, but also empowered them to take hold of these opportunities by supporting their agency- their voice, choice and decision making in economic spaces. AWEF interventions helped to strengthen voice, choice and control for 75,107 women.
