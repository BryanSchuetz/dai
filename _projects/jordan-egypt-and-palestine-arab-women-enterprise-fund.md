Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and the Islamic Development Bank and working in Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine, Arab Women's Enterprise Fund (AWEF) is the first project of its kind. AWEF will stimulate increased women's economic empowerment and agency through a [market systems approach][1]. This partnership will address gaps in women's economic empowerment in the region, which has one of the lowest rates of female labour force participation in the world. AWEF’s goals include improved gender awareness and sensitivity across target companies’ human resources policies, increased employment and retention of women in the labour force, and raised awareness and uptake of standards and certification of products made by women working at home.

AWEF is the only market systems-based development programme in the region that also puts women's economic empowerment at the core of its objectives and impacts. DAI is joined by subcontractors Market Share Associates, a global social enterprise focused on collaborative approaches to international development, and Education for Employment, a nongovernmental organization working throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
