DAI assisted the Chevron Corporation with the [strategic design ](https://www.devex.com/en/news/chevron/81078)of the Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND), a Nigerian-registered [foundation,](https://www.devex.com/en/news/beyond-philanthropy-what-happens-when-a/82220) by helping outline a strategy for its economic development program, specifically orienting its activities around a Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P) approach and developing monitoring and evaluating mechanisms to document their impact. Collectively, these recommendations informed the principles of intervention, program areas, sustainable outcomes, and intermediate and final impacts of the Foundations 2011–2014 Strategic Plan. We also identified resources to execute the economic development component of the plan, and established criteria for prioritizing projects and selecting implementing partners.

### Sample Activities

* Assure [PIND](http://www.inclusivebusinesshub.org/facilitating-market-led-inclusive-agribusiness-investment/)'s plan coheres with and integrates into its broader social and business objectives.

* Provide long-term technical assistance and capacity building expertise to help implement the strategic plan and operationalize the Economic Development Centre into a sustainable local institution.

* Train foundation and centre staff and implementing partners in the M4P approach and techniques of value chain analysis.

* Supervise implementation of five value chain studies by local partners.

* Help PIND plan and refine program activities targeting systemic value chain development programs, infrastructure projects designed to create sustainable employment through building the capacity of local firms to provide high labor intensity contracting, and business linkage programs to enhance the ability of local firms to supply goods and services to international oil companies.

### Select Results

* Identified key economic sector opportunities in the Delta Region through industry studies and value chain analyses to determine the optimum point of leverage for market strengthening interventions and focusing on broader value chains for which Chevron's significant spend represents a strong growth market.

* Identified and addressed underlying causes of weak market performance and the exclusion of the poor by facilitating changes in market systems to improve incomes.

* Designed Chevron's Economic Development Program, which informs interventions, program areas, sustainable outcomes, and intermediate and final impacts of PIND's Strategic Plan 2011–2014, and developed monitoring and evaluating mechanisms to document impact.

* Operating an Economic Development Center in Warri, Nigeria, to allow communities to take advantage of opportunities in Chevron and surrounding supply chains.

* Decreased violent social disruptions and reduced social risks due to higher levels of inclusive growth.

* Lowered costs for goods and services sourced locally due to more competitive business practices.

* Increased the quality of local goods and services from better production techniques.
