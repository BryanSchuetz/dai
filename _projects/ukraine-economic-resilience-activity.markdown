Even before the onset of Russia’s 2022 war in Ukraine, eastern Ukraine was saddled with communities ripped apart, disrupted markets, and internally displaced people (IDP). The U.S. Agency for International Development's [Economic Resilience Activity (ERA)](https://era-ukraine.org.ua/) aims to boost the economic resilience of Ukraine in the face of a conflict that has left industry ransacked, communities divided physically and politically, and the social, financial, and physical assets that underlie resilience ravaged. The program works to diversify the industries and improve IDP integration with the rest of the country, while also helping them gain locally needed job and livelihood skills.

### Sample Activities

* Provide technical assistance and cost-share grants to conflict-affected businesses.
* Work with partner institutions to adapt workforce training curricula to reflect in-demand skills.
* Promote regional exports to the European Union and other international markets.
* Improve access to finance for entrepreneurs and small businesses.
* Raise awareness of the importance of emerging industries for the region’s economic future.

### Select Results

* Assisted 935 vulnerable and hard-to-reach beneficiaries—of whom 61 percent were female—in the first year with training and technical assistance.
* Supported grantee Ukrainian Leadership Academy to host a youth forum called
“[Every Tomorrow Starts Today](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=528382821056937).” More than 400 young leaders from all 24 oblasts of Ukraine helped develop a vision for “Ukraine 2030.” 
* Worked with a small group of “pathfinder farmers” to help them to grow cherry tomatoes that are in high demand by national retail stores that resulted in a contract to regularly ship the tomatoes to Fozzy Group, which owns more than 500 supermarkets throughout Ukraine. The [cooperative](https://www.usaid.gov/npi/stories/fresh-tomatoes-front-lines-war-usaid-helps-boost-entrepreneurs-ukraine) is now in sales negotiations for sale of new products next year and ERA is scaling up the pilot to farming communities.
