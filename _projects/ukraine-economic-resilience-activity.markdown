Even before the onset of regional instability, eastern Ukraine was saddled with lagging industries. Recent conflict has further crippled local industry by disrupting market links and displacing entire communities. With a shrinking working-age population, anemic economic growth, and high unemployment, the region has struggled to rebound.

The Economic Resilience Activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is working to strengthen the economy of eastern Ukraine in response to these setbacks. The program is working to diversify the region’s industries and improve its integration with the rest of the country, while also helping residents to gain locally needed job skills.
