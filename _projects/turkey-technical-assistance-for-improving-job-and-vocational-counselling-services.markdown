The labour market in Turkey suffers from low employment rates, particularly among women and young people, with a relatively high proportion of young people in the country, and a mismatch between the demand for, and supply of, labour. The supply of workers with university or vocational qualifications has outpaced the labour market’s ability to absorb such workers. The role of the private sector in fostering the demand for more and better skills is also relatively limited. Finally, 30 percent of gross domestic product is linked to the informal sector, which explains Turkey’s low productivity relative to the European Union. 

The Technical Assistance for Improving Job and Vocational Counselling Services project is geared towards supporting the Turkish Employment Agency (İŞKUR) to fulfil its mandate as the lead provider of public employment services in Turkey. 

The Agency is present in all provincial directorates, but with 3.5 million people registered as unemployed in 2018, there is significant demand for İŞKUR’s services. 

At current staffing levels, it is estimated that each of its job and vocational counsellors are responsible for nearly 900 unemployed people. While the recruitment of 830 counsellors in 2019 (until December) facilitated an improved ratio of unemployed people per counsellor, the need for İŞKUR to deliver its services as effectively and efficiently as possible is paramount. 

Our project develops the institutional and human capacities of the Agency, alongside the development and utilisation of innovative tools designed to improve job matching and career guidance services and the further development of awareness-raising measures and coordination mechanisms.
