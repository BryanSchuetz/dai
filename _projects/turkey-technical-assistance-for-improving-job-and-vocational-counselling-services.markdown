Turkey's labor market suffers from low employment rates, particularly among women and young people, and a mismatch between the demand for, and supply of, labor. The number of individuals with university or vocational qualifications has outpaced the market’s ability to absorb such workers. The private sector currently plays a limited role in fostering the demand for more and better skills—and 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product is linked to the informal sector, contributing to Turkey’s low productivity relative to the European Union. 

The Technical Assistance for Improving Job and Vocational Counselling Services project supports the Turkish Employment Agency (İŞKUR) to fulfil its mandate as the country's lead provider of public employment services. İŞKUR maintains a presence in all of Turkey's provincial directorates, and with 3.5 million people registered as unemployed in 2018, there is significant demand for its services. 

At the agency's current staffing levels, each job and vocational counsellor is responsible for an estimated 900 unemployed people. While the recruitment of 830 counsellors in 2019 (until December) facilitated an improved ratio of unemployed people per counsellor, the need for İŞKUR to deliver its services as effectively and efficiently as possible is paramount. 

Our project develops the institutional and human capacities of the Agency, alongside the development and utilisation of innovative tools designed to improve job matching and career guidance services and the further development of awareness-raising measures and coordination mechanisms.
