The award-winning More Mobilising Access to Maternal Health Services in Zambia (MORE MAMaZ) programme was an integrated programme that empowered rural communities to address the household and community-level barriers preventing women and girls from accessing maternal and newborn health services.

The programme achieved transformational change for women and girls, particularly those who are under-supported at household and community level, by supporting government partners to scale up HPI’s community engagement approach.
