DAI and lead partner Everis will provide European Union negotiators with quantitative tools to assess the government procurement markets in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Thailand. We will be supported throughout this work by sector and market leaders from the London School of Economics, and employ a large pool of short-term experts—international and local—to collect and process the relevant data in each partner country.
