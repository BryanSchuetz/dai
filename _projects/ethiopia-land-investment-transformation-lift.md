While still one of the poorest countries in the world, Ethiopia has made many advances in reducing poverty levels and increasing agricultural production. The pace of these advances however, is constrained by inefficiencies in the rural land sector, including weak documentation and management of land rights.

The Land Investment for Transformation programme (LIFT), funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), is improving the incomes of the rural poor and vulnerable populations in Ethiopia and enhancing economic growth through second-level land certification and improved rural land administration. The programme team works with the government of Ethiopia to improve the effectiveness of the rural land sector by increasing land tenure security and to enhance the productivity and incomes of farmers, [especially women](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/womens-land-rights-and-the-problem-of-polygamy-a-proposal-in-ethiopia/) and vulnerable groups.

### Sample Activities

* Implement a second-level land certification process in which 14 million parcels of rural land will be certified, 70 percent of the holders of which will be held by women either  jointly or individually.

* Set up a rural land administration system to sustain the certification process and ensure [farmers' security](http://www.seepnetwork.org/blog/improved-land-security-promotes-financial-inclusion-ethiopian-farmers) of land holding.

* [Increase access to credit](https://beamexchange.org/community/blogs/2017/11/13/land-tenure-security-financial-inclusion/) and improve policies and institutions to enhance opportunities for rental lands and service providers.

* Increase investment by farmers in planting trees and using improved seeds and agricultural practices.

### Select Results

* Established system for regularising land ownership and identified and registered 5.5 million land parcels, providing greater security of tenure and social stability, as well as encouraging investment.

* Ensured that nearly 90 percent of land certificates now include the name of a woman.

* Enabled 5,000 farmers to take advantage of individual loans, totaling $5 million, as a result of holding their second level land certificate.

* Introduced a network of 300 land rental service providers, who have facilitated more than 7,000 formal land rental transactions in rural areas.

* Advanced implementation of a new Rural Land Administration System to record post registration land transactions.

* Produced evidence-based land policy reports, including gender and social inclusion research, to allow government stakeholders to make informed decisions on land governance.
