We are helping key Palestinian sectors compete in regional and global markets![Devs----Gaza-fish-4.jpg](/uploads/Devs----Gaza-fish-4.jpg). Targeted sectors in the West Bank and Gaza include agribusiness, tourism, information and communications technology, stone and marble, [fishing](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/dreams-come-true-as-onshore-fish-farms-emerge-in-gaza/), and garments. To facilitate their expansion, we provide companies with technical assistance and expertise to maximize the value of their products. We are connecting smaller businesses with larger producers and exporters that have direct and more efficient access to markets. Our industry-wide approach leverages the U.S. Agency for International Development’s past investments and helps these smaller businesses link into, actively participate in, and benefit from sector-wide economic growth and development activities. By increasing the flow of information, products, and technology throughout these sectors, [The Compete Project](http://www.competeproject.ps/index.php) is empowering firms to perceive and take hold of the opportunities around them. Through the innovative Firm Level Assistance Program, Compete shares the cost and risk, encouraging investment and sustainability.
