UNITED supports the Nigerian government in controlling seven neglected tropical diseases (NTD)—blinding trachoma, bilharzia, elephantiasis, river blindness, hookworm, whipworm, and roundworm.

The targeted NTDs are preventable with proven, cost-effective interventions such as mass drug administration, which involves distributing four drugs once or twice a year to everyone in a community to prevent the seven diseases.

DAI Global Health is responsible for UNITED's health system strengthening work stream. This involves working with the Ministry of Health and other key stakeholders at the federal and state levels to ensure that the national NTD control programme has the most appropriate structure, resources, capacity, plans, and budgets, as well as effective coordination mechanisms. A robust health system will contribute to improving the provision of sustainable mass drug distribution, broad-based communication and coordination, and more effective health care at all levels.

Led by Sightsavers, the consortium also comprises Helen Keller International, CBM, MITOSATH, Carter Centre, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine—Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, London Centre for NTD Research, Partnership for Child Development and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Natural History Museum, Accenture Development Partnerships, and Crown Agents.
