The Integrated Approach to Neglected Tropical Diseases (UNITED) programme supports the Nigerian government in controlling seven neglected tropical diseases (NTD)—blinding trachoma, bilharzia, elephantiasis, river blindness, hookworm, whipworm, and roundworm.

The targeted NTDs are preventable with proven, cost-effective interventions, such as mass drug administration, which involves distributing four drugs once or twice a year to everyone in a community to prevent the seven diseases.

As many of the NTDs are tackled using similar community mechanisms, an integrated programme implementation approach is used, in which drugs for different diseases are administered at the same time. The UNITED programme has reached 13.8 million people with annual mass treatment to reduce illness, and distributed more than 110 million treatments in northern states of Kano, Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna, and Niger.

Led by Sightsavers, the consortium also comprises Helen Keller International, CBM, MITOSATH, Carter Centre, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine – Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases, the London Centre for NTD Research, the Partnership for Child Development and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Imperial College, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Natural History Museum, Accenture Development Partnerships, and Crown Agents.

DAI Global Health is responsible for the health systems strengthening workstream, which involves budget advocacy to ensure political commitment and spending for NTDs. UNITED has successfully built capacities at national and sub-national levels on resource mobilization for NTDs programmes and, in collaboration with partners, contributed to the government allocating budget lines for NTDs in the UNITED-supported states. The programme has also led to the integration of some NTDs intervention areas into the overall health sector agenda to maximize available resources from other disease interventions for NTDs programme.
