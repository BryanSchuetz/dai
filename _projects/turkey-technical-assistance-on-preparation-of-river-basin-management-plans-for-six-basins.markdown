Turkey is at increasing risk of water scarcity due to its growing population, infrastructural developments, overexploitation of watersheds, pollution, and climate change. The development of river basin management plans is important for the sustainable management of water and is part of Turkey’s implementation of the [European Union Environmental acquis](http://www.ecranetwork.org/Horizontal-Activities/Handbook-EU-Environmental-Acquis). 

DAI is strengthening Turkey’s capacity to prepare river basin management plans for six out of the 25 river basins in the country. The plans summarise the state of the water environment; pressures affecting the water environment where its status is less than good; set statutory objectives for river, lake, groundwater, transitional, and coastal water bodies; and contain measures needed to achieve them.  
 
The plans will be developed in accordance with the [European Union Water Framework Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/index_en.html) (WFD), which requires member states to improve the health of river basins in the Union by 2027.

### Sample Activities 

* Analyse data requirements and collect required data both from Ankara and on-site, data requirement analysis report. 
* Review river basin districts, water bodies, typologies, classes, and categories.  
* Analyse the pressure and impacts on water bodies.  
* Update monitoring programmes for the six basins. 
* Prepare significant water management issues reports.  
* Carry out a study visit to an EU Member State to evaluate their experience with the significant water management issues.
