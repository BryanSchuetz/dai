DAI works with the Government of Mauritius to improve capacity and coordination across key institutions dealing with climate change, including the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, Land Drainage Authority, and National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Centre. 

The team fosters the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in the government’s public policies and is preparing transformational climate programmes to be financed by the French Development Agency and international climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund.
