Significant potential for sustainable energy investments remains untapped in the Western Balkans while improvement in sustainable energy still faces many barriers. WeBSEFF I and II continue the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's support to the region by providing debt financing to businesses, municipalities, and energy service companies for energy projects undertaken in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, and Serbia. The goal: reduce energy intensity and promote diverse sources of green energy in a region where rising energy prices remain a challenge.

WeBSEFF I has allocated €60 million to 131 projects in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Due to this success, a second phase of the project was launched in July 2013 with additional financing of €45 million available to participating financial institutions.

DAI is partner to E3 International on both facilities and provides technical assistance in the implementation of dedicated credit lines, specifically assisting the participating financial institutions to on-lend the funds to qualified applicants.

###  Sample Activities

* Provide technical assistance to banks on the development of marketing strategies that raise awareness of energy efficiency.
* Advise projects on identifying, designing, and implementing projects that reduce energy use and save firms money.
* Assess applying projects' eligibility.
* Determine whether there might be better energy-saving options for individual projects.
* Conduct energy audits.
* Assess individual project's technical and financial viability.
* Conduct cash flow analyses.
* Help with loan applications to participating banks.
