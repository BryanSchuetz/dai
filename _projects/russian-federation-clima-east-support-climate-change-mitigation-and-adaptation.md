The countries of the ENP East region—[Armenia][1], Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are signatories of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, and as such have a number of obligations. The Clima East programme works to help integrate the countries' climate change strategies, greenhouse gases mitigation plans and adaptation approaches, with activities carried out across the region. The programme is part of a larger [Clima East][2] package, to include a pilot project component, implemented by UNDP, supporting the development of ecosystems-based approaches to climate change.
