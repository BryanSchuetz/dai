The countries of the ENP East region—[Armenia][1], Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine—and the Russian Federation are signatories of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, and as such have a number of obligations. The Clima East programme works to help integrate the countries' climate change strategies, greenhouse gases mitigation plans and adaptation approaches. The programme is part of a larger [Clima East][2] package, to include a pilot project component, implemented by UNDP, supporting the development of ecosystems-based approaches to climate change.

###  Sample Activities

* Establish a detailed position on climate change, and fully engage in international climate change negotiations.
* Organise regional training workshops around climate change mitigation and adaptation.
* Disseminate information and knowledge on EU _acquis_, or accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions that constitute the body of European Union law.
* Plan study missions to Brussels and EU member states and send EU experts to the partner countries.
* Evaluate the environmental and economic effectiveness of existing and proposed policies, strategies, and market-based mechanisms.
* Support national stakeholder consultations, policy making and draft national strategies.

###  Select Results

* Increased understanding of the EU Climate Change and energy acquis and the 20/20/20 agenda.
* Responsible public institutions will competently address the Kyoto- and post-Kyoto regime under the UNFCCC, and be strengthened to comply with regulations.
* Developed state-of-the-art national climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.

* Prepared national and/or regional emissions trading schemes.
* Progress made in elaboration of low carbon/low emissions development strategies.
