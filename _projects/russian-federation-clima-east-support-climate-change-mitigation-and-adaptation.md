The countries of the ENP East region—[Armenia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5rPl1AZDfA&feature=youtu.be), Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are signatories of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, and as such have a number of obligations. The Clima East programme helped integrate the countries' climate change strategies, greenhouse gases mitigation plans and adaptation approaches, with activities carried out across the region. The programme was part of a larger [Clima East](http://www.climaeast.eu/) package that supported the development of ecosystems-based approaches to climate change.
