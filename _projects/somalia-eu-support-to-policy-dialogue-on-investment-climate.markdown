The EU Support to Policy Dialogue on Investment Climate in Somalia project works to enhance the investment climate and business environment in the country by improving access to finance, markets, and essential services for medium, small, and micro enterprises (MSMEs). 

Our technical assistance team provides support to reinforce the capacities of key public institutions and the private sector in order to strengthen public-private dialogue; support Somalia’s exports and access to regional markets; and ^promote responsible business conduct across the Somali private sector.
By improving the policy, regulatory, and institutional environment for investment promotion and facilitation, trade, and value chain development, the project supports facilitates socioeconomic resilience, especially in the context of COVID-19. It focuses particularly on the financial sector and investments, EU-Somalia business linkages, and food security and nutrition.
In a context of economic integration of Somalia in the Horn of Africa, the project will contribute to building peace and trust in Somalia and encourage dialogue between Somalis on private sector matters. It is aligned with the Africa-Europe Alliance on Sustainable Investments and Jobs, the EU External Investment Plan approach (Sustainable Business for Africa Platform – SB4A) and EU Economic Diplomacy objectives and Guidelines.
