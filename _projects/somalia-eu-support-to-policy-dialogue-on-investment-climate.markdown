The European Union (EU) Support to Policy Dialogue on Investment Climate in Somalia project is enhancing the investment climate and business environment by improving access to finance, markets, and essential services for medium, small, and micro enterprises (MSMEs).

Our team provides support to reinforce the capacities of key public institutions and the private sector to strengthen public-private dialogue; support Somalia’s exports and access to regional markets; and promote responsible business conduct across the private sector.

By improving the policy, regulatory, and institutional environments for investment promotion and facilitation, trade, and value chain development, the project facilitates socioeconomic resilience, especially in the era of COVID-19. We focus in particular on the financial sector, business linkages with Europe, food security, and nutrition.

To better integrate Somalia’s economy in the Horn of Africa, the project encourages dialogue between Somalis on private sector matters. Our efforts align with the [Africa-Europe Alliance on Sustainable Investments and Jobs](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/africaeuropealliance_en), the EU External Investment Plan approach ([Sustainable Business for Africa Platform–SB4A](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/sustainable_business_for_africa.pdf)), and EU economic diplomacy objectives and guidelines.
