Regional conflicts have negatively impacted Lebanon’s economy and led to increased social and political tensions in communities hosting Syrian refugees. One result has been strained government resources and poor public services delivery. Amidst these challenges there is growing enthusiasm among Lebanese youth to contribute to their country’s socio-economic development through social enterprise business models that create social value and serve marginalized populations. However, there are very few avenues of support in Lebanon to help promising social entrepreneurs launch and grow new mission-oriented businesses. 

The Lebanon Social Enterprise Pilot Project (SEPP), funded by the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) (branded as [SoUK.LB](http://www.souklb.co/) – Social Enterprise Hub), uses an evidence-based approach to demonstrate the potential of the social enterprise model to deliver social and economic impact in Lebanon. DAI, along with its local consortium partners, will work with social enterprises from high-impact sectors to accelerate and strengthen their organisational capacity through training, mentoring, and financing.
