Regional conflicts have negatively impacted Lebanon’s economy and led to increased social and political tensions in communities hosting Syrian refugees. One result has been strained government resources and poor public services delivery. Amidst these challenges there is growing enthusiasm among Lebanese youth to contribute to their country’s socio-economic development through social enterprise business models that create social value and serve marginalized populations. However, there are very few avenues of support in Lebanon to help promising social entrepreneurs launch and grow new mission-oriented businesses. 

The Lebanon Social Enterprise Pilot Project (SEPP), funded by the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), uses an evidence-based approach to demonstrate the potential of the private sector-led social enterprise model to deliver economic growth and improve social cohesion in Lebanon. DAI’s team works with social enterprises from targeted sectors to accelerate to strengthen their organisational capacity through training, mentoring, and financing. Key findings from the project will inform the design of the FCO’s wider approach to supporting growth in the social enterprise sector.  

## Sample Activities

* Organise and lead sprint design competitions and business development trainings for both start-up and growth stage social enterprises. 
* Provide seed funding to help enterprises advance to next level of growth. 
* Establish a monthly SE Stakeholders Forum and a quarterly International Advisory Committee to advise on project activities.

Develop an impact assessment framework and indicators to monitor SE performance and guide future FCO approaches to supporting SE growth.
