Regional conflicts have negatively impacted Lebanon’s economy and led to increased social and political tensions in communities hosting Syrian refugees. One result has been strained government resources and poor public services delivery. Amidst these challenges there is growing enthusiasm among Lebanese youth to contribute to their country’s socio-economic development through social enterprise business models that create social value and serve marginalized populations. However, there are very few avenues of support in Lebanon to help promising social entrepreneurs launch and grow new mission-oriented businesses. 

The [Lebanon Social Enterprise Pilot Project (SEPP)](http://souklb.co/), funded by the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), uses an evidence-based approach to demonstrate the potential of the private sector-led social enterprise model to deliver economic growth and improve social cohesion in Lebanon. DAI’s team works with social enterprises from targeted sectors to accelerate to strengthen their organisational capacity through training, mentoring, and financing. Key findings from the project will inform the design of the FCO’s wider approach to supporting growth in the social enterprise sector.
