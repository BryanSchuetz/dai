We are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded the COVID-19 Recovery and Resiliency Through Digitization of Caribbean Financial Institutions and their MSME Clients program. This program is hosted by the IDB Lab, the IDB’s innovation center, leveraging funding from the Canada Cooperation Framework.
 
Spanning the Caribbean—notably Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago—this three-year engagement will work to increase the adoption of digital innovations that promote business resilience and enhance productivity among financial institutions and their micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) clients. The focus is on facilitating access to FinTech and other digital solutions, largely by creating pathways for adoption in collaboration with local incubators, accelerators, innovation hubs, and FinTech businesses.
DAI’s technical assistance will support (i) upgrading financial institutions’ internal business operations and client services through digitalization and online banking solutions; and (ii) facilitating access for their MSME customer base to a wider ecosystem of fit-for-purpose solutions and financial technology, such as eCommerce, online inventory management, and digital marketing.
 
This award builds on the DAI Sustainable Business Group’s increasingly successful partnership with the IDB and expands DAI’s IDB portfolio in the region to five projects. SBG delivered a regional Covid-19 Credit Risk Impact Assessment for the IDB across 13 financial institutions in the region—the recommendations from which supported the design of this new project—then participated in a project design process to develop the overall project framework and metrics.
 
This program affords DAI a great opportunity to draw connections with other digital financial inclusion projects in our portfolio and seek co-investment to grow this initiative for the IDB. Thanks and congratulations to everyone who contributed to the win.
