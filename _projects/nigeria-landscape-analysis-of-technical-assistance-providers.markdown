On behalf of the Gates Foundation, DAI is building a database of competent organizations providing services in primary healthcare, policy advocacy, and communications. This study will provide a profile of the range and capacity of organizations providing technical services in Nigeria’s development sector, with an emphasis on healthcare, policy advocacy, and communications. The organizations of interest include technical partners, private sector entities, nongovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, faith-based organizations, foundations, academic, and research institutes. The review focuses on different dimensions of each organization’s performance—including expertise, portfolio content, and client mix—to pinpoint the development challenges it can best address.
