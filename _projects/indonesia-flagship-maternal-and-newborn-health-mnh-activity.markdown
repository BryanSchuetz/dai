As a fast-rising economic power, Indonesia has made significant progress toward key development goals, including greatly reducing child mortality. However, maternal and newborn deaths still occur at higher rates compared to neighboring countries, particularly among poor and vulnerable populations. A number of intertwining factors contribute to increased negative outcomes for mothers and babies, from inadequate policies and inefficient budgeting for reproductive health, to overconcentration of health workers in urban areas and difficult road access to rural health clinics.


To support the Indonesian people in tackling these myriad challenges, The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Flagship Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) Activity, which promotes the development of locally led solutions to prevent maternal and newborn deaths and extend essential health services to remote and impoverished areas. Our unique facilitating approach will bring diverse local stakeholders together to co-create innovative life-saving ideas, and then provide technical assistance and seed funding to take promising new solutions to scale.

### Sample Activities

* Address evidence gaps by identifying where maternal and newborn deaths are occurring and work with local partners to co-define problems.

* Bring together actors from within and outside of the health system to use local evidence and global best practices to co-create, test, and adapt solutions to improve MNH outcomes.

* Engage the public and private sectors to co-finance scalable local solutions that address MNH-related issues for underserved populations.
