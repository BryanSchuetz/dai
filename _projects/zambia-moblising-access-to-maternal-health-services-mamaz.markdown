In Zambia, health indicators remain poor, with an estimated 2,600 maternal deaths annually, and a neonatal mortality rate of 30 deaths per 1,000 live births. The average rate of delivery by skilled birth attendants has remained stagnant at below 50 percent for more than 20 years.

The Mobilising Access to Maternal Health Services in Zambia (MAMaZ) programme was implemented in six districts in Central, Western, Southern and Muchinga provinces in rural Zambia and reached a population of more than 250,000 people.

The programme addressed the factors that affect access to maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services, in particular emergency obstetric neonatal care, and developed appropriate home-based care of women who were pregnant or had recently delivered, as well as for their babies.

MAMaZ worked directly with communities to build social approval for behaviour change and to assist communities to develop their own emergency response systems. The programme worked through existing structures, and the change process was community-led and managed by community health volunteers.
