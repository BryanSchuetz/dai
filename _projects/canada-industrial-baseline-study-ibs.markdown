DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) delivered an industrial baseline study (IBS) to assess the offshore oil and gas industry in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Over eight months, SBG created a cost decomposition of offshore oil and gas operations to forecast potential local content and job creation using its Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM). This research and exercise helped support a Canadian corporation’s efforts to address weaknesses in its supply chains and promote the strengths of Newfoundland and Labrador’s existing supply base.
