Climate shocks continue to undermine Honduran development efforts. Hurricanes, drought, and other extreme weather events exacerbate food insecurity and water scarcity, which in turn hamper poverty reduction efforts, provoke social unrest, and drive irregular migration. Perhaps nowhere is this vicious cycle more evident than in Honduras, where the COVID-19 pandemic and back-to-back tropical storms, combined with consecutive years of below-average rainfall, have decimated the economy, and led to growing food insecurity. 

Hondurans require new approaches to build resilience that will enable them to thrive—where they are.

The Building Climate Resilience Activity strengthens the capacity of Honduran systems to respond to climate variability and change, thereby helping address underlying factors that contribute to irregular migration.

## Sample Activities 

* Increase access to and use of reliable hydromet information—by national, regional, and municipal decision makers—to foster evidence-based decision-making. 
* Streamline policies, regulations, and processes, or develop new models, to enable an integrated water management approach in the most vulnerable and degraded sub-watersheds.
* Strengthen the accountability and sustainability of the Fund for the Management of Protected Areas and Wildlife, which supports Honduras’s public and private protected areas and reserves. 
* Increase sustainable tourism investments.
* Institutionalize improved management of parks and protected areas through training and capacity building.
