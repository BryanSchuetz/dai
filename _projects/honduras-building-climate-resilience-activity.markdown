As climate change stresses the forests of Honduras, making them more susceptible to insects and wildfires, other threats from deforestation and degradation—driven by agricultural expansion and extractive activity—exert even more pressure. Meanwhile, calamitous weather, including dire droughts and tropical cyclones, are altering key watersheds. This vicious cycle compounds longstanding poverty, marginalization, and food insecurity; erodes community cohesion, further weakening local systems and contributing to migration; and limits opportunities for young people to build their futures in Honduras.

Hondurans require new approaches to build resilience that will enable them to thrive—where they are.

## Sample Activities 

* Increase access to and use of reliable hydromet information—by national, regional, and municipal decision makers—to foster evidence-based decision-making. 
* Streamline policies, regulations, and processes, or develop new models, to enable an integrated water management approach in the most vulnerable and degraded sub-watersheds.
* Strengthen the accountability and sustainability of the Fund for the Management of Protected Areas and Wildlife, which supports Honduras’s public and private protected areas and reserves. 
* Increase sustainable tourism investments.
* Institutionalize improved management of parks and protected areas through training and capacity building.
