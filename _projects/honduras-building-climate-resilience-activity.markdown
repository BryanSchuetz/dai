As climate change stresses the forests of Honduras and renders them more susceptible to threats such as insects and wildfires, simultaneous threats from deforestation and degradation—driven by agricultural expansion and extractive activity—exert even more pressure on those same forests. Meanwhile, shifting precipitation patterns, including worsening drought and stronger tropical cyclones, are altering the hydrology of key watersheds. This vicious cycle compounds longstanding poverty, marginalization, and food insecurity; erodes community cohesion, further stressing already weak local systems and contributing to high rates of internal and outward migration; and limits opportunities for young people to build their futures in Honduras.
