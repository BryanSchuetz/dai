The Somalia People-Centered Governance Project (PCG) supports local governance in southern Somalia, helping district councils to adopt inclusive decision-making models, more fairly manage resources, deliver results and services for citizens, and—in so doing—increase citizen trust in the councils.
 
PCG works in 12 districts to support newly formed councils, building the capacity of officials to better perform their jobs and ensure that resources and disputes are managed fairly and with citizen participation, avoiding capture by clan groups or elites. PCG also focused on improving the performance of the councils, supporting them to identify and respond to citizen priorities and become more sustainable by delivering services, collecting revenues, and creating channels for communication with citizens. Combining embedded technical assistance, grants, and construction funds, PCG seeks to expand service delivery to 800,000 citizens.
