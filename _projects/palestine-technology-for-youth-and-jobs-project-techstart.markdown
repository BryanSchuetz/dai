TechStart is designed to assist the Palestinian IT ecosystem to upgrade firm capabilities and spur employment growth. TechStart builds the capacity of Palestinian firms, strengthens demand from international buyers and investors, and stimulates the absorption of high-tech knowledge in the ecosystem.

The project also includes special activities to address COVID-19 by ensuring that the IT services sector is positioned to contribute to Palestine’s economic recovery. For example, it assists sound firms to weather the liquidity shock through wage support for companies undertaking virtual training and process or systems upgrades; helps firms facing demand shocks to reposition themselves, through advisory and market linkage services; and provides grants or early-stage business advisory services to existing or newly launched firms with the potential to reconstitute the industry.
  
### Sample Activities

* Strengthen the capabilities of firms and their workforces, addressing the capability shortfalls, information asymmetries, and other factors that dissuade firms from investing in capacity-building activities on their own. 
* Support the entry of new, complementary actors into the IT ecosystem, aiding the private sector to build the technology and business infrastructure that IT service companies rely on to compete, including finance. 
* Stimulate demand through international market linkages and will encourage foreign direct investment in the West Bank and Gaza.
