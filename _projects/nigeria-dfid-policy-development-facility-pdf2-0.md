The [Policy Development Facility II](https://www.pdfnigeria.org/) was a flexible, rapid-response facility that supported “champions of change”—primarily federal ministers, but also other high-level government officials such as the Office of the Vice President—to implement economic and social policies that further reduce poverty in Nigeria.

PDF II supported the Nigerian government in making its ministries, departments, and agencies more efficient, leading to substantial financial savings and increased transparency. The programme promoted clean energy generation through its role in the implementation of Nigeria’s electrification strategy and the creation of green bonds. Finally, PDF II enhanced trade and investment through its advisory role to the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and its work establishing a non-oil export community of practice.

* Promote evidence-based, pro-poor policy dialogue to strengthen the institutional linkages between the suppliers and consumers of information.
* Use highly innovative “anecdote circles” to engage groups in experiential sharing, conflict resolution, team building, and sustainable action for reform.

### Select Results

* Created 27,765 direct, indirect, and induced jobs as a result of support across a number of initiatives, including energising economies, green bonds, innovation hubs, and fertiliser initiatives.
* Deployed 116 embedded advisers across 155 projects to support Nigeria’s reforms for poverty reduction and economic growth. 
*  Helped the Ministry of Finance in 2015 save 184.2 billion naira on the government’s top five expenditure items between 2014 and 2017 with a thorough review of work processes and practices, and improving government procurement to enhance value for money, leading to a shift in institutional culture.
