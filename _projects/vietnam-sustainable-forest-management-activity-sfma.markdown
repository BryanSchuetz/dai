The Vietnam Sustainable Forest Management Activity (SFMA) helps the Government of Vietnam reduce carbon emissions associated with deforestation, the degradation of natural forests, and poor plantation management. SFMA implements a “Green Prosperity” approach that strengthens local communities’ ability to protect their natural resource base and reduce emissions while building a strong foundation for sustainable livelihoods and equitable economic growth.
 
In six provinces, SFMA will strengthen community forest management models to address organizational capacity, livelihoods, finance, enforcement, and equitable benefit sharing.
