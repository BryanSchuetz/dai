Limitations on land ownership, access to markets, and high-quality seed varietals constrain people’s ability to either manage their forests effectively or to derive additional benefits from that management. This results in lower levels of carbon sequestration, limits community livelihood opportunities, and contributes to degradation and encroachment on the forests themselves. By addressing the intertwined issues of economic opportunity and forest governance, the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) project supports Vietnam’s efforts to manage vital forest areas while helping its people share in the country’s rapid growth in an equitable, sustainable way.  

SFM helps the Government of Vietnam reduce carbon emissions associated with deforestation, the degradation of natural forests, and poor plantation management. SFM implements a “Green Prosperity” approach that strengthens local communities’ ability to protect their natural resource base and reduce emissions while building a strong foundation for sustainable livelihoods and equitable economic growth.
 
In six provinces, SFM will strengthen community forest management models to address organizational capacity, livelihoods, finance, enforcement, and equitable benefit sharing.
