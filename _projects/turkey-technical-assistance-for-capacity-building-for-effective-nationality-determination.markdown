Turkey is a country with two sea borders, placed between eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and the Middle East. It lies at a crossroad for inter-regional and intercontinental migration. Within the last decade, the civil unrest in the Middle East particularly destabilized the region, with the domino effect of uprisings leading to conflict and civil war, in turn leading to significant migration flows out of the region. Managing migration both into and through its borders is a pressing issue for Turkey.

The project is to improve Turkey’s legal and administrative framework in the field of migration management by establishing a well-functioning migration management system in line with the EU acquis and EU standards. The purpose is to improve the institutional capacity of the Turkish Directorate General of the Migration Management (DGMM) for nationality identification through piloting a Language Analysis System (LAS).

The development, implementation and evaluation of the LAS pilot - allied with targeted capacity building and the establishment of a range of policy dialogue mechanisms - will enable the process of nationality determination of irregular migrants in Turkey. 

This intervention is a critical element towards strengthening the migration management system in Turkey.

### Sample Activities

* Develop and establish a comprehensive LAS, encompassing all required regulations, procedures, and tools for gathering evidence.
* Strengthen through training programmes DGMM's staff at central and local levels and staff at other relevant agencies such as law enforcement on nationality identification.
* Increase knowledge management and research capacity related to the country of origin information.
* Boosting intra- and inter-institutional cooperation on issues related to nationality determination is enhanced.

### Select Results

* Developed the concept for the Language Analysis System (LAS).
* Analyzed 565 voice samples by both human experts and Accent Recognition System (ARS), submitted to DGMM.
* Developed the LAS Procedures Manual approved by DGMM. 
* Developed training manual reviewed by DGMM.
* Ongoing developments of an e-learning system and e-learning contents in Turkish are being integrated onto the DGMM platform.
