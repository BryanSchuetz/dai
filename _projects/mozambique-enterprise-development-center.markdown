MozUp is the Enterprise Development Center (EDC) in Mozambique supporting Mozambican small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to become competitive and capable suppliers of the nascent natural gas sector and other growing sectors of the local economy. The Center is operated by Mozambique Enterprise for Sustainability, a joint venture between DAI and Mozambican implementing partner Taciana Peão Lopes Consulting.

Sponsored by Area 4 Partners of the Rovuma Basin in Mozambique, MozUp was launched in 2020 to strengthen Mozambican businesses and create a more competitive and capable marketplace across the various growing sectors of the Mozambican economy, including the LNG sector. Working with local SMEs, MozUp provides training, mentoring, advisory, and networking opportunities to improve business processes, management, and overall operations, including the promotion of ethical business practices.

MozUp opened its first office in Maputo in 2020, providing in-person assistance to SMEs as well as virtual services to SMEs across the country. In May 2023, MozUp opened its second office in Pemba, expanding its physical reach to SMEs in Cabo Delgado and the northern region of the country.

Since its launch, MozUp has contributed to the development and growth of SMEs and their workforce, providing them with access to new skills and opportunities, with many SMEs attributing new contract awards to MozUp activities and support.\
