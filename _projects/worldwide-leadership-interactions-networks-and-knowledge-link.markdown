The Policy LINK project plays an integral role in transforming agricultural policy systems worldwide, thereby improving food security outcomes in line with the [U.S. Global Food Security Strategy](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/us-government-global-food-security-strategy) and advancing countries on their journeys to self-reliance.

Rather than developing policies or directing policy-making processes outright, Policy LINK strengthens the capacity of local actors and institutions to lead agricultural transformation processes in their respective countries and regions. It builds on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s and DAI’s almost nine years of experience on the [Africa Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program (Africa Lead)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-leadership-training-and-capacity-building-program-africa-lead) and [Building Capacity for African Agricultural Transformation (Africa Lead II)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-africa-lead-ii).

Policy LINK works with local and regional partners via sub-awards to design and implement activities; develop strategic partnerships with nonstate actors—particularly private businesses and associations—to expand investment in human and social capital; and promote learning networks that enable stakeholders from government, the private sector, academia, and civil society to collaborate across a region, technical challenge, or cohort.

## Sample Activities

* Enhance food security leadership and management capacities.
* Strengthen communication, coordination, and cooperation among institutions for more effective and accelerated policy implementation.
* Empower local actors and communities to influence food security policy and governance decisions that affect them.
* Increase participatory policy learning and knowledge-sharing practices.
