Covering a population of approximately 19 million in four states of Northern Nigeria, the Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria / Maternal Newborn and Child Health programme (PRRINN/MNCH) combined health systems strengthening with routine immunization and maternal, newborn, and child health interventions.

Working in states with some of the world’s worst indicators for maternal, newborn, and child health, PRRINN-MNCH revitalized primary health care and improved the availability, quality, and utilization of maternal, newborn, and child health services, including ante-, peri- and post- natal care, emergency obstetric and newborn care, essential care for newborns and infants, young child feeding and nutrition, and routine immunization against preventable diseases.
