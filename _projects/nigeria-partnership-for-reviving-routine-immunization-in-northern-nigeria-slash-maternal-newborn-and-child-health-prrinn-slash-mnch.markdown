Covering a population of approximately 19 million in four states of Northern Nigeria, the Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria / Maternal Newborn and Child Health programme (PRRINN/MNCH) combined health systems strengthening with Routine Immunization (RI) and Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) interventions.

Working in states which have some of the world’s worst indicators for maternal, newborn and child health, PRRINN-MNCH  aimed to revitalize Primary Health Care (PHC) and improve the availability, quality and utilization of maternal, newborn and child health services, including ante-, peri- and post- natal care, emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC), essential care for newborns and infants, young child feeding and nutrition, and routine immunization against preventable diseases.
