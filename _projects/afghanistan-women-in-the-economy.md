The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Promote: Women in the Economy (WIE) program [bolstered women’s inclusion](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/out-of-hiding-assisting-young-educated-women-in-afghanistan-to-finally-enter-the-workforce?utm_source=daidotcom) in Afghanistan’s economy and worked to ensure that progress made by Afghan women over the past decade endures and advances.

WIE worked across 30 Afghan provinces from its offices based in five economic zones. The program [assisted women-owned businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vERAa1RX3cY) and businesses that employ at least 30 percent women to improve performance, income growth, and sustainability. To this end, WIE delivered technical assistance, industry-specific business skills training, and access to finance and markets to leverage growth in the private sector.

WIE supported women ages 18 and above to find new or better jobs through job skills training based on market demand, and work experience placements in internships, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training activities. The program gave Afghan women the opportunity to gain work experience, prove their capabilities to employers, and secure new or better positions.

Consortium partners included RSI Consulting (monitoring and evaluation) and the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University.
