The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Promote: Women in the Economy (WIE) program is [bolstering women’s inclusion](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/out-of-hiding-assisting-young-educated-women-in-afghanistan-to-finally-enter-the-workforce/?utm_source=daidotcom) in Afghanistan’s economy and working to ensure that progress made by Afghan women over the past decade endures and advances.

WIE is based in four economic zones across and works in 30 Afghan provinces. WIE [assists women-owned businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vERAa1RX3cY)—and businesses that employ at least 30 percent women—to improve performance, grow, and sustain.

WIE supports women ages 18 and above to find new or better jobs through career counseling, workplace skills development, and job skills training based on market demand. Consortium partners include the Afghanistan Microfinance Association, Rumi Consultancy, and RSI Consulting (M&E), as well as the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University.
