The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Promote: Women in the Economy (WIE) program is [bolstering women’s inclusion](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/out-of-hiding-assisting-young-educated-women-in-afghanistan-to-finally-enter-the-workforce/?utm_source=daidotcom) in Afghanistan’s economy and working to ensure that progress made by Afghan women over the past decade endures and advances.

WIE is based in five economic zones and works across 30 Afghan provinces. WIE [assists women-owned businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vERAa1RX3cY) and businesses that employ at least 30 percent women to improve performance, income growth, and sustainability. The program provides technical assistance, industry-specific business skills training, and access to finance and markets to leverage growth in the private sector.

WIE supports women ages 18 and above to find new or better jobs through career counseling, workplace skills development, and job skills training based on market demand. These activities take place in partnership with training providers to deliver services and fund scholarships for training and certification programs. The program gives Afghan women the opportunity to gain work experience, prove their capabilities to employers, and secure new or better positions.

Consortium partners include Rumi Consultancy, RSI Consulting (M&E), and the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University.
