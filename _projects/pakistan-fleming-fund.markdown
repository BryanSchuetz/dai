The Fleming Fund is a U.K. Department of Health and Social Care programme to help low- and middle-income countries fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). DAI’s Fleming Fund program in Pakistan is a collaboration with the Pakistani government to strengthen systems using a “One Health” approach—a multisectoral approach to complex health problems that reaches across human health, animal health, and environment sectors. As global leaders in One Health, the DAI team will help incorporate One Health across programme interventions. DAI will help Pakistan become a leader in combating antimicrobial resistance, and a model for better management of antimicrobials in human and animal populations.

## Sample Activities

* Use an evidence-to-action approach that builds on existing assessments to enable a nuanced understanding of antimicrobial resistance, challenges and opportunities, entry points and policy constraints.
* Foster a data for decision-making mindset, where decision-makers demand evidence for policy and stakeholders are empowered to hold those decision-makers accountable.
* Build a national-level multisectoral coordination mechanisms to effectively address the complexities of AMR/AMU, strengthening information-sharing and coordination across public and private sectors and catalysing political commitment and leadership to drive the AMR agenda.

Fleming Fund Pakistan partners include the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Aga Khan University, and Health Security Partners.
