Half of all Liberians generate their income through agriculture, yet agriculture is not seen as a business by the vast majority of Liberian farmers. Using an approach tailored to specific conditions and locations, this project is helping Liberia achieve food security—in terms of food availability, utilization, and affordability—by building incentive structures that assist local stakeholders to adopt a commercial approach.

Our market-led and value chain-driven methodology builds indigenous capacity, and focuses on benefiting Liberia's women and [youth][1]. New market linkages are catalyzing income and job growth and increases in the production, processing, marketing, and nutritional utilization of rice, cassava, and vegetables in Bong, Lofa, Nimba, Grand Bassa, Montserrado, and Margibi counties, a region targeted as a development corridor that fosters commerce, simultaneously [improving food availability][2] and access and dietary diversity.

FED is Africa's largest project under President Barack Obama's Feed the Future Initiative, which promotes a move away from subsistence and increasing food security by working with public and private bodies, including the Government of Liberia, the private sector, local nongovernmental groups, and other key stakeholders.
