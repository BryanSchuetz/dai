Trade and private sector engagement are recognized as key drivers for poverty reduction through their capability to spur growth and investment, create good-quality jobs, and generate tax revenues to fund public services. However, experience shows that improved market access alone is not always sufficient for sustained economic development. Access often needs to be complemented by policy measures that support lasting and equitable prosperity.

The Trade, Private Sector Development, and Engagement (TPSD/E) Facility I was established to support the implementation of the European Union (EU)'s 2014 Private Sector Communication, and to shape and implement new policy orientations, in particular geared toward the EU’s [External Investment Plan (EIP)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/stronger-global-actor/external-investment-plan_en). With the TPSD/E I Facility, DAI provided technical expertise to EU staff working on private sector and trade in Brussels and worldwide, created and shared knowledge inside the institution, and supported the visibility of the Directorate-General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA).

TPSD/E II consolidates and expands upon the gains made in building the capacity and knowledge of EU institutions to deliver results during the previous phase. Our team of experts delivers technical assistance, capacity building and communications, and visibility in: women’s economic empowerment; green economy; digitalisation; sustainable value chains and investment; trade; access to finance and investment facilitation; public-private dialogue and business environment reform; and skills development vocational training. 

Considering the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus pandemic that started in 2020, TPSD/E II engages with the EU at headquarter and EU Delegations globally, supporting a comprehensive response strategy to the crisis with an emphasis on economic and social resilience.
