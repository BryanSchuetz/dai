Trade and private sector engagement are recognized as key drivers for poverty reduction through their capability to spur growth and investment, create good-quality jobs, and generate tax revenues to fund public services. However, experience shows that improved market access alone is not always sufficient for sustained economic development. Access often needs to be complemented by policy measures that support lasting and equitable prosperity.

The Trade, Private Sector Development, and Engagement (TPSD/E) facility was established by the European Commission to support the implementation of its 2014 Private Sector Communication, and shaping and implementing new policy orientations, in particular geared toward the European Union’s [External Investment Plan (EIP)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/stronger-global-actor/external-investment-plan_en). By leveraging financial assistance, guarantees, and supporting improvements to the business environment, the EIP aims to [catalyse private sector investment in partner countries](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/eu-launches-26-billion-fund-to-attract-investment-in-the-european-neighbourhood-and-africas-fragile-states/) in Africa and the European Neighbourhood and contribute to meeting Sustainable Development Goals. 

With the TPSD Facility, DAI provides technical expertise to EU staff working on private sector and trade in Brussels and worldwide, creates and shares knowledge inside the institution, and supports the visibility of the European Commissions’ Directorate General for International Development Cooperation (DEVCO).
