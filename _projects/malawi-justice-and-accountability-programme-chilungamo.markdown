The Government of Malawi has stated its commitment to contributing to dignified lives for its citizens through an accountable government, informed democratic choice, and the humane and effective delivery of justice.

The EuropeAid-funded Chilungamo (means justice) programme contributes to increased levels of governance, accountability, compliance with the rule of law, and respect, promotion, and protection of human rights in Malawi. The team works to reduce the burden on the criminal justice system; emphasise the need for coordination in the criminal justice system as a whole; reduces prison overcrowding; and increase access to justice for both victims and offenders.

* Organized rallies with mobile accountability clinics in the target districts. Mobile accountability clinics are platforms for empowering citizens and communities, complaints lodging, prompt investigations, and holding duty bearers accountable. The clinics include public rallies, sensitization meetings with village development committees, area development committees, prompt investigations of some of the complaints and concerns raised during sensitization meetings and public rallies, and sensitization meetings with district-level bureaucrats, based on the issues and concerns reported during the rallies and meetings. About 17,000 people have been reached through public rallies and brochures. 
* Boosted the efficiency of the Human Rights Section at the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.

The report, which was approved by Department of Human Resource Management & Development validates the structure for the provision of community correction and reintegration services, which include functions such as community services and public works, probation services, parole, and compassionate release. 
* Trained 55 police prosecutors, investigators, and victim support officers in DNA collection.
* Improved access to justice for vulnerable groups in both the formal and informal systems.
