There is an opportunity for catalytic forces within Colombia to refocus the Government on transparently responding to the needs of citizens and—in the short-term—protecting a weak and underfunded healthcare system. The COVID-19 crisis presents a window of opportunity to address longstanding concerns. This moment could help Colombians and their government reimagine the future of their democracy. Colombia is well-positioned with politically savvy civil society organizations to use today’s entry points to make governance more transparent and accountable tomorrow. 

The Partners for Transparency (PfT) program supports locally driven solutions that increase transparency and accountability and reduce corruption in Colombia. This activity strengthens citizen-responsive governance and increases citizen trust by leveraging targeted stakeholders’ expertise, engagement, and unique positions of influence.
