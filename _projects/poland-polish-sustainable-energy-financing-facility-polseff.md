We are [creating a perpetual market](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/how-banks-can-help-businesses-in-developing-countries-to-greatly-reduce-their-energy-costs/?utm_source=daidotcom) for investments in efficient energy by Poland's local businesses by training financial institutions on how to appraise and finance sensible energy projects; detailing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the competitive advantages of investing in energy-efficient materials and equipment; and training local experts to assist SMEs in identifying and preparing technically feasible, bankable projects. Following the success of the first phase of the program, PolSEFF II provides a new energy efficiency credit line through local participating financial institutions. The facility will provide up to a €200 million credit line, following the previous phase's €180 million disbursal, through a framework to commercial banks and leasing companies in Poland for on-lending to small and medium enterprises to finance investments in energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy. This work will help build lasting capacity for this type of finance in Poland, which is presently highly reliant on foreign energy.
