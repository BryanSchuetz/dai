Despite significant progress made through donor and nongovernmental organization investments over the past 30 years, a large percentage of Africans still lack access to clean water and proper sanitation. Water for Africa through Leadership and Institutional Support ([WALIS](https://www.globalwaters.org/WALIS)) reflects the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s [latest thinking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ps-GXU9LQpxzSHNREGMfoE8WOPU4Zp6) on achieving transformative improvements in access to clean water and improved sanitation. Building on past support programs such as the [Further Advancing the Blue Revolution Initiative](/our-work/projects/middle-east-and-north-africa-further-advancing-blue-revolution-initiative-fabri), WALIS places greater focus on the challenge of building the capacity of national and regional leaders to capture and apply evidence in the development of policies, strategies, programs, and investments. This initiative will bolster the ability of [African leaders](https://www.globalwaters.org/resources/assets/snapshot-stockholm-building-africa%E2%80%99s-leadership-sanitation-recap), donors, and stakeholders to use existing data and analyses to shape water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) strategies, program plans, and budgets. WALIS provides technical, programmatic, administrative, and logistical support to USAID in improving the capacity of African water sectors. DAI leads the team that includes partners Training Resources Group, Cloudburst Consulting, and Taoti Creative.
