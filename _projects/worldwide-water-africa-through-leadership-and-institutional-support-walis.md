Despite significant progress made through donor and nongovernmental organization investments over the past 30 years, a large percentage of Africans still lack access to clean water and proper sanitation. Water for Africa through Leadership and Institutional Support ([WALIS](https://www.globalwaters.org/WALIS)) reflects the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s latest thinking on achieving transformative improvements in access to clean water and improved sanitation. Building on past support programs such as the [Further Advancing the Blue Revolution Initiative](/our-work/projects/middle-east-and-north-africa-further-advancing-blue-revolution-initiative-fabri), WALIS places greater focus on the challenge of building the capacity of national and regional leaders to capture and apply evidence in the development of policies, strategies, programs, and investments. This initiative will bolster the ability of [African leaders](https://www.globalwaters.org/resources/assets/snapshot-stockholm-building-africa%E2%80%99s-leadership-sanitation-recap), donors, and stakeholders to use existing data and analyses to shape water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) strategies, program plans, and budgets. WALIS provides technical, programmatic, administrative, and logistical support to USAID in improving the capacity of African water sectors. DAI leads the team that includes partners Training Resources Group, Cloudburst Consulting, and Taoti Creative.

### Sample Activities

* Develop, monitor, and analyze sound sector data.
* Engage in targeted research and pilot activities around constraints in the water sector.
* Strengthen country systems to develop informed policy and sectoral planning for sustainable water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.
* Increase the capacity of regional organizations and USAID staff required to improve the collection and use of sector knowledge.

### Select Results

* Improving national water and sanitation data quality in four provinces of Mozambique by providing 75 tablets to the National Water and Sanitation Information System.
