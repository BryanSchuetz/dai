Afghan municipalities have long suffered from underinvestment, limited support, low revenues, and weak institutional capacity. As a result, services and infrastructure in municipalities are minimal. Of the total population of urban households, only 10 percent have piped water systems; 20 percent have consistent city power, and 14 percent lack any access to electricity. Inadequate sanitation services result in high rates of infant mortality.

The Regional Afghan Municipalities Program for Urban Populations, Regional Command East (RAMP UP East) supported 14 provincial capitals. Its primary customers were municipal officials such as mayors, revenue officers, and engineers as well as the citizens who benefit from municipal services.

RAMP UP East helped municipalities implement projects through which local officials improved their capacity to deliver services and build satisfaction, trust, and support among citizens. All programming put municipal officials in front and demonstrably in charge as they directed participatory planning processes and oversee implementation.
