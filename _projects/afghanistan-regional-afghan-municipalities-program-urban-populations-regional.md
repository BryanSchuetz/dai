Afghan municipalities have long suffered from underinvestment, limited support, low revenues, and weak institutional capacity. As a result, services and infrastructure in municipalities are minimal. Of the total population of urban households, only 10 percent have piped water systems; 20 percent have consistent city power, and 14 percent lack any access to electricity. Inadequate sanitation services result in high rates of infant mortality.

RAMP UP East supports 14 provincial capitals. Its primary customers are municipal officials such as mayors, revenue officers, and engineers as well as the citizens who benefit from municipal services.

RAMP UP East helps municipalities implement projects through which local officials improve their capacity to deliver services and build satisfaction, trust, and support among citizens. All programming puts municipal officials in front and demonstrably in charge as they lead participatory planning processes and oversee implementation.
