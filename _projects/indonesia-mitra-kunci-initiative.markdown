Indonesia is a growing regional and global player, having experienced a remarkable democratic and economic transformation over the last two decades. However, the country remains at a development crossroads, with 40 percent of the population earning less than $2 a day.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Mitra Kunci Initiative is providing Indonesia’s poorest and most vulnerable with skills needed to be productive members of Indonesia’s workforce. [Young people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoItcAx_xnY&feature=youtu.be), women, and people with disabilities will receive training, information, and resources to prepare them to meet the needs of the private sector.
