The Preparedness and Response (P&R) project is one component of the U.S. Agency for International Development's[ Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT 2)][1] program. The EPT initiative detects and responds to viruses such as Ebola, avian influenza, and MERS that move between animal and human populations. EPT is, in turn, part of the Obama Administration's Global Health Security Agenda, which brings together U.S. Government agencies and other national governments to address natural and manmade disease threats worldwide.

[P&R](http://preparednessandresponse.org/) has a dual mandate to help countries design and implement national preparedness and response plans for public health events of unknown etiology and to establish and strengthen National One Health Platforms. Our goal is to help address the practical issues confronting national governments as they strive to cope with the human, financial, and logistical constraints associated pandemic threats. The P&R project provides technical assistance and training services to build national and regional capacity in a sustainable manner.
