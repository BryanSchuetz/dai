client: "DAI is delivering the £95 million contract component of the Partnership for
  Learning in Nigeria (PLANE), the FCDO’s flagship education program, which operates
  in Kano, Kaduna, and Jigawa states. Of the 20 million Nigerian children out of school,
  Kano accounts for some 2 million. Several factors account for Kano’s poor education
  indicators, including poor infrastructure, lack of training for teachers and other
  personnel, lack of basic materials such as books, and poor service quality, as reflected
  in low completion rates and inadequate enrolment of girls. Addressing these challenges
  requires concerted efforts across government, civil society, and relevant stakeholders;
  this conference was designed to bring these stakeholders together to identify the
  most important gaps in Kano’s education sector and develop a road map to sustainably
  address them. DAI is leading on coordinating the conference and leveraging on its
  knowledge of the context and stakeholders in the state, as well as its programme
  resources to seamlessly deliver the Conference. Sample Activities •\tProvide support
  to the Kano State Government to convene the Kano State Education Recovery Conference
  \ •\tDevelopment of the Education Sector SWOT Matrix  •\tDevelopment of Sustainability
  Framework: Pathways for Continued Improvement and Reform  •\tDevelopment of the
  Conference Report: Comprehensive Documentation of Activities and Outcomes Select
  Results In July 2024, DAI and the Arewa Consultative Forum supported the Kano State
  Government in hosting a two-day Education Recovery Conference at Dangote Business
  School. The event convened policymakers, educators, development partners, community
  leaders, civil society representatives, and academics to advance the Kano State
  Education Recovery initiative. Aimed at revitalizing the state's education sector,
  the conference focused on enhancing quality, access, equity, and performance in
  basic literacy and numeracy. The proceedings yielded valuable recommendations, many
  of which were endorsed in the final conference communique."
