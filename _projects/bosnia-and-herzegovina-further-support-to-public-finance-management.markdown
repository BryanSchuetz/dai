Bosnia and Herzegovina has a unique and complex system of public finance. The general government sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina includes institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, entity governments (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska), Brčko District, cantonal and city/municipal authorities, and extrabudgetary funds. 

The Further Support to Public Finance Management project enables authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to improve public finance management by increasing expenditure effectiveness and the budget planning process.

In terms of budget planning, the project strengthens organizational frameworks, developing a detailed structure of budget users and creating performance indicators to ensure that mid-term budget planning is accepted by all state governments and entities so the process can achieve the results of government policies as stated in the Framework Budget Document. Additionally, the project aims to develop the human capacities of the relevant financial institutions, through shared expertise from member states and current European Union candidate states, to improve the process for programme budget planning at all levels of government.

### Sample Activities

* Improve programme budgeting process and alignment with the mid-term policy planning process at all levels of government.
* Increase human resources capacity for programme budget planning at all levels of government.
