The Skills for Prosperity Mexico (S4PM) project works to prepare learners to go from the classroom to the workforce with the right skills for the marketplace.
 
S4PM is increasing Mexico’s capacity to build an inclusive education-to-employment ecosystem that generates more productive and equitable skills sectors improving employability, employment opportunities, and earning potential of youth beneficiaries including the most marginalised populations.  

Achieving inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction will require changing the way government, private sector, and education and training providers work together to make skills investments up and down the talent pipeline, enabling all young Mexicans to benefit from shared prosperity. If relevance is increased and quality is enhanced, and equity is strengthened, then marginalised youth will have access to higher-quality and market-aligned vocational training and higher education that will put them on pathways to better quality jobs and increased incomes.  
 
DAI's team includes International Youth Foundation, Pearson, and U.K. Skills Federation.
