The Skills for Prosperity Mexico (S4PM) project works to prepare learners to go from the classroom to the workforce with the right skills for the job and for the marketplace.
 
The United Kingdom is a leader in education-to-employment (E2E) partnerships. Through S4PM, DAI will draw on best practices both from Britain’s experience and from promising Mexican models of public-private collaboration—in states such as Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Nuevo Leon, and Queretaro—to strengthen E2E partnerships nationwide. Bringing the industrial and education sectors together, S4PM will enable the education-to-employment system to equip the Mexican workforce for the jobs of today, tomorrow, and 10 years’ time, enhancing value up and down the talent pipeline for all segments of society.
 
Team Leader Miguel Armendáriz, a former Director for Strategic Projects at the Ministry of Education, brings to the project more than 20 years of experience in workforce development and educational policies at local, regional, and national levels in Mexico. He is currently advising authorities in the Yucatan Peninsula states, preparing a single Peninsula 2019-20 TVET and Higher Education strategy. He will lead a team that includes the International Youth Foundation, Pearson, and U.K. Skills Federation.
 
This award represents DAI’s fourth Prosperity Fund win in Mexico, and given the project’s emphasis on workforce development and supply chain components there is significant potential for collaboration with our Energy Services programme. The win also marks a welcome return to skills and education programming for the HMG team, better positioning DAI for anticipated opportunities in this field, including in Myanmar.
