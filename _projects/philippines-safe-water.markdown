The Philippines Safe Water project provides local government units, water service providers, and watershed councils in target provinces with the information, incentives, and partnerships they require to identify and address barriers to a water-secure future—yielding life-saving gains in access to water supply and sanitation services for unserved and underserved households in the Philippines’ most water-stressed communities. 
 
By applying a systems approach that strengthens linkages between upstream and downstream stakeholders in the Zamboanga Peninsula and Sarangani and Palawan Provinces, Safe Water works to: increase access to resilient water supply and sanitation services; improve sustainable management of water resources; and strengthen water sector governance.
 
The project is expected to strengthen services for some 1.1 million Filipinos.
