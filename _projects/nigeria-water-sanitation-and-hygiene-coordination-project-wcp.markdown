summary: The state of Nigeria’s water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector has reached
  an alarming state of decline, with nearly one third of the population lacking access
  to improved drinking water sources and approximately two thirds living without adequate
  sanitation facilities. With one of the fastest growing urban populations in the
  world, Nigeria’s municipal centers in particular are likely to face increasing difficulty
  in meeting the water and sanitation service needs of their citizens.

The state of Nigeria’s water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector has reached an alarming state of decline, with nearly one third of the population lacking access to improved drinking water sources and approximately two thirds living without adequate sanitation facilities. With one of the fastest growing urban populations in the world, Nigeria’s municipal centers in particular are likely to face increasing difficulty in meeting the water and sanitation service needs of their citizens.

Despite these challenges, reform-minded states in the country’s impoverished northern region have shown a commitment to necessary policy changes and an interest in actively collaborating with development partners. The WASH Coordination Project (WCP), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), will assist these forward-looking states and utilities in improving WASH governance and service delivery. DAI will support Development Innovations Group in the implementation of WCP through data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and institutional capacity building.

**Sample Activities**

* Provide baseline data, analysis, and recommendations on engaging civil society and non-governmental organizations in improving the urban WASH sector.

* Conduct urban sanitation baseline surveys and frameworks for improvement.

* Provide capacity building training and draft criteria for including states in urban WASH sector reform and coordination activities.

* Contribute to the creation of a community of practice to collect best practices on urban WASH and to share impacts and lessons with policymakers.

* Provide support in conducting environmental, gender, and sustainability analyses related to water and sanitation factors in target regions.
