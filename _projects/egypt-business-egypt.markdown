Business Egypt aims to substantially increase sales revenues and investments among Egyptian micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), thereby creating new job opportunities, especially for women and youth. We will co-invest with an ecosystem of institutions—business service providers, business associations, supportive government institutions, and more—to offer new products and services enabling MSMEs to better meet market demand and increase their sales. The result will be the creation of thousands of new jobs, particularly in our proposed value chains: solar power, processed fruits and vegetables, information technology services, ready-made garments, and automotive supply.
 
DAI’s implementation approach makes maximum use of Egyptian resources. The bulk of technical implementation will be carried out by our three Egyptian partners—Acumen Consulting, N Gage Consulting, and the American University of Cairo Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation—while DAI will provide technical direction, management, capacity building, and information systems support.
