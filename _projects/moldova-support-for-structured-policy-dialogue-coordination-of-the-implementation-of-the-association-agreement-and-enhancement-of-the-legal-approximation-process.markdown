With the signing of the European Union-Moldova Association Agreement (AA) in 2016, which included a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), Moldova opted for political association and economic integration with the EU. This AA/DCFTA was unprecedented and is expected to stimulate domestic reforms and to complete Moldova’s transition to a well-functioning market economy. Further implementation of the AA/DCFTA should bring Moldova the benefits of increased trade, integration into the EU single market and institutional and socio-economic modernization.

The DAI-led technical assistance project is to increase the capacities of the Government of the Republic of Moldova and other key national institutions in implementing the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Agenda in line with the Association Agreement throughout all sectors. Thus, we will contribute to the acceleration of the AA/DCFTA implementation and making this process more participatory and transparent.

Drawing upon the best EU and international practices our approach is focused on providing tailormade technical assistance to the Central public authorities of the Republic of Moldova involved in the AA monitoring and implementation: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, the State Chancellery; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure; the Parliament; and the other key project target groups to comprehensively address its needs.
