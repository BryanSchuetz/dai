The effects of economic growth and urbanization in Turkey have resulted in greater demand for more efficient and renewable forms of energy and a better waste management system. To deal with these challenges, Turkey recognizes that it must transition to a more “circular” growth model, and it is making efforts to harmonize its environmental regulatory framework with European Union standards in this area as part of the EU Accession process.

The EU circular economy action plan is intended to reduce pressure on natural resources and create more sustainable growth and jobs, the plan envisages initiatives along the entire lifecycle of products, influencing how products are designed, promoting circular economy processes, encouraging sustainable consumption, and seeking to prevent waste.

Our project promotes the transition to the circular economy and is helping set up a national framework to achieve this goal. We are also identifying the challenges and gaps in Turkey’s current waste and resource management system, to help develop the knowledge, technical, and institutional capacity necessary to bring about the country’s economic transition in line with EU’s circular economy action plan.
