The effects of economic growth and urbanization in Turkey have resulted in greater demand for more efficient and renewable forms of energy and a better waste management system. To deal with these challenges, Turkey is making efforts to harmonize its environmental regulatory framework with European Union (EU) standards as part of the overall EU Accession process.

Our project promotes a transition to a circular economy—contributing to a more efficient resource and waste management across Turkey. It aims to strengthen institutional and technical capacities in the country and set up the national Circular Economy framework, in line with the EU Circular Economy Package. 

Additionally, our team identifies the challenges and gaps in the current waste and resource management system in Turkey, whereas capacity building has a central place in the transfer of theoretical and practical knowledge to the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU).
