Kosovo’s education system has undergone substantial reforms in the past few decades and improving the quality of education provision is central to the country’s efforts to foster European integration. While the frameworks have been established, the implementation still needs to be reinforced. 

The technical assistance is to enhance the quality-based, accountable education and training system in Kosovo, in line with the best international practices in the field of pre-university education.

A fundamental issue to be addressed in relation to recruitment of teachers and principals remains the high degree of variance across municipalities in the application of recruitment procedures and management of the selection process. This intervention will strengthen mechanisms related to the implementation of merit-based non-discriminatory, gender-equal and transparent recruitment of teachers and school principals and also teacher professional development (TPD) in a systematic manner. The process of consolidation of quality assurance mechanisms at the school level has not yet been completed and the project will identify, formulate and establish sets of minimum performance standards in teacher training, qualifications, certification, etc. It will also design and implement regulations, tools, and modalities of quality enforcement and compliance. The project will also contribute to building institutional capacity to implement the new Law on School Textbooks and to publish and revise school textbooks.

### Sample Activities
 
* Establish a mechanism for quality, non-discriminatory, gender-equal, and criterion-based recruitment of school directors and teachers.
* Develop a strategic plan for a periodic and ad-hoc evaluation of schools’ performance and initiation of monitoring processes for a new outcome-based curriculum at the central and local levels.
* Enhance a more integrated and well-defined legal and regulatory framework—in line with international and European standards and practices—to underpin the drafting and digitization of school textbooks.
