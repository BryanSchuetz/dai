The Oil and Gas Association of Tanzania (OGAT), comprising 12 international oil and gas companies in Tanzania, established a Local Content Committee in 2015 to support the efforts of the Government of Tanzania to stimulate inclusive economic growth through policy, plans and legislation, addressing the issue of local content. 

In 2016, OGAT began working with our Sustainable Business Group (SBG) to design and implement its local content stakeholder engagement process. SBG produced the first Local Content Benchmarking Study for Tanzania to support the engagement efforts by identifying best practice from other jurisdictions in the development and implementation of respective local content regimes. 

Drawing on key conclusions from this study, SBG held a series of Local Content Exchanges to promote open dialogue on priority local content topics with stakeholders.
