Limitations on land ownership, access to markets, and high-quality seed varietals constrain people’s ability to either manage their forests effectively or to derive additional benefits from that management. This results in lower levels of carbon sequestration, limits community livelihood opportunities, and contributes to degradation and encroachment on the forests themselves. By addressing the intertwined issues of economic opportunity and forest governance, the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) project supports Vietnam’s efforts to manage vital forest areas while helping its people share in the country’s rapid growth in an equitable, sustainable way.  

SFM helps the Government of Vietnam reduce carbon emissions associated with deforestation, the degradation of natural forests, and poor plantation management. SFM implements a “Green Prosperity” approach that strengthens local communities’ ability to protect their natural resource base and reduce emissions while building a strong foundation for sustainable livelihoods and equitable economic growth.
 
In six provinces, SFM will strengthen community forest management models to address organizational capacity, livelihoods, finance, enforcement, and equitable benefit sharing.

### Sample Activities
 
* Develop inclusive forest co-management models with community forest management groups and our subnational partner agencies to improve forest governance and provide technical assistance to co-management plan implementation in areas such as technical [silviculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silviculture), integrated pest management, rights to resource access, financial management tools, or sustainable forestry techniques and technologies. 
* Pilot and roll out the national carbon payment for forest environmental services program—an innovative initiative to generate revenue for forest management through industrial carbon emitters.
* Provide technical assistance and tools to communities to help them participate as effective government counterparts in improved natural production forest management. 
* Strengthen conservation enterprises in key value chains and develop value chain action plans. 
* Support law enforcement to maintain forest integrity through analysis and action planning.
* Implement interventions that strengthen grower groups, increase production of high-quality timber products, and create replicable, scalable models.
