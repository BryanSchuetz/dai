In Vietnam and worldwide, widespread forest degradation from illicit timber harvesting, forest land conversion and poor forest management practices is leading to increased carbon emissions, which threaten the environment, communities, and livelihoods. Despite national increases in overall tree coverage, Vietnam’s natural forests are reducing in area and worsening in quality.    

Vietnam has 14.79 million hectares of forests that provide carbon, ecosystems, and economic services at local, national, and global scales. The country has a rapidly developing economy with a robust and growing wood processing industry. This growth has also come at a price of increased greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Despite national increases in overall tree cover, there is a reduction in total area of natural forests and forest quality in the country.  

From 2020-2025, the USAID Sustainable Forest Management Project is linking communities, local authorities, the national government, and the private sector to jointly address the drivers of forest conversion and degradation in targeted areas. The project aims to avoid carbon emissions from natural forest conversion and degradation; increase carbon sequestration through better management of plantation forests; and improve the quality, diversity, and productivity of natural production forests.    

Activities are centered around engagement with the private sector and improved co-management by communities, local authorities, the national Government.   

The Project is achieving this goal through five inter-linked objectives: 1) improve and expand community forest management (CFM); 2) increase conservation-friendly enterprises (CFEs) in forest-dependent communities; 3) increase the functionality of law enforcement systems to address forest crimes; 4) improve production forest management practices; and 5) mobilize domestic resources for forest management and protection.

### Sample Activities
 
* Develop inclusive forest co-management models with community forest management groups and our subnational partner agencies to improve forest governance and provide technical assistance to co-management plan implementation in areas such as technical [silviculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silviculture), integrated pest management, rights to resource access, financial management tools, or sustainable forestry techniques and technologies. 
* Pilot and roll out the national carbon payment for forest environmental services program—an innovative initiative to generate revenue for forest management through industrial carbon emitters.
* Provide technical assistance and tools to communities to help them participate as effective government counterparts in improved natural production forest management. 
* Strengthen conservation enterprises in key value chains and develop value chain action plans. 
* Support law enforcement to maintain forest integrity through analysis and action planning.
* Implement interventions that strengthen grower groups, increase production of high-quality timber products, and create replicable, scalable models. 

### Select Results

* Supported seven provinces in developing forest law enforcement action plans. The project conducted six consultation workshops for 134 participants to finalize the plans, which will support law enforcement, improved enforcement practices, and the environmental judicial system.
* Signed a partnership agreement with the Biomass Fuel Vietnam Co., Ltd. to leverage $7.5 million to promote more than 5,000 hectares of Forest Stewardship Council-certified plantation forests from 3,000 small-scale forest owners in Nghe An province. 
* Conducted a study in Thanh Hoa province on how customary laws support or hinder the effort for effective management and forestry law enforcement; what practices can be used by concerned parties to ensure effective forest governance and equity at the grassroots level; and how law enforcement agencies in Thanh Hoa should prevent and deal with potential violations and conflicts between customary law and legal regulations.
* Supported the Vietnam Administration of Forestry in developing the Gender Equality Action Plan, 2021–2025, a commitment towards leadership, economics, gender-based violence prevention, research, and gender integration into technical activities of the forestry sector. 
* Trained 17,500 people in community forest management, value chain development, law enforcement, sustainable forest management, and monitoring Payment for Ecosystems Services. 
* Built capacity of 44 organizations, including 22 government agencies, 8 conservation-friendly enterprises, and 14 community organizations. 
* Developed 29 policies—5 national, 17 subnational, and 7 at the community level.
* Mobilized more than $10 million in investment from the government and the private sector.
* Handed over 1 million Acacia mangium seedlings to 400 households from 9 communes and 192 kilograms of seeds for 13 nurseries in 4 districts. Hoa Binh province will be able to seed 5,500 hectares of plantation forests with this high-quality planting material.
