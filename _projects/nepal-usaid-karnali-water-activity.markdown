Despite pockets of progress, Nepal’s water security, as measured by the metrics of equity, functionality, and ecosystem health, is among the weakest in Asia. Recent achievements, such as the reduction of open defecation, are impressive—but fragile, especially in the Karnali River Basin. The USAID Karnali Water Activity works across the Karnali River Basin in Western Nepal to promote healthy, resilient, and water-secure communities by improving water resources management practices, drinking water supply and multiple-use systems, and fecal sludge management access and treatment plants. 

We are using a OneWater approach that knits together actors (community, municipal, watershed, and national) to achieve water security goals. OneWater creates an integrated vision and drives collective action in the Karnali River Basin by mapping assets, risks, and attitudes; convening stakeholders to align interests; co-designing and co-implementing plans and interventions; and rigorously monitoring, learning, and adapting for impact and sustainability.

## Sample Activities

* Strengthen water management systems for safe and sustainable water services, including climate-resilient water safety plans.
* Develop social behavior change strategy, campaign, and capacity-strengthening measures for water safety and conservation.
* Conduct citywide sanitation planning exercises that include fecal sludge management, city drainage, and solid waste systems.
* Develop policies and regulations for improved watershed-level water resource management. 
* Support the identification of ecologically significant areas to conserve biodiversity and water.

## Select Results

* Installed a tap in Khadachakra Municipality where 38 families previously had to walk 20 miles for water.
* Established 162 water user and sanitation committees, with a 68 percent representation of marginalized populations and 50 percent women.
* Completed a comprehensive citywide sanitation plan in seven municipalities.
* Provided support for 20 WASH bills at the municipal level, with 15 of them receiving endorsement from respective councils.
* Facilitated 29 municipalities to develop water use master plans, all approved by local governments.
* Assessed 11,841 spring sources, and protected 30 water sources, safeguarding 26.45 hectares of biologically significant areas.
* Conducted 354 capacity-building/awareness-raising sessions for water user and sanitation committees, communities, and local governments to improve WASH governance for sustainable service delivery.
