Over the past 15 years, Afghanistan has developed a country-wide network of agricultural input suppliers, Afghan farmers have embraced improved technologies, and a cadre of agricultural produce retailers and exporters has begun to emerge. However, market constraints such as high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and a poor enabling environment created excessive market risks for agribusinesses. These challenges have deterred private investment in livestock-related enterprises and hindered growth in the agriculture sector overall.

The Afghanistan Value Chains–Livestock (AVC-Livestock) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, takes a market systems development approach to identifying and removing constraints to growth in the livestock sector. The project offers management consulting to promising anchor firms to help them expand into domestic and international markets, attract private investment, and improve the business enabling environment. By increasing productivity for farmers and businesses working in poultry, sheep, dairy, and other value chains, AVC-Livestock is helping to raise incomes for thousands of households and create jobs for men, women, and youth.
