AVC-Livestock builds the capacity of livestock-related enterprises, or anchor firms, so they become more efficient and profitable. Working directly with agribusiness companies through co-investment agreeements, AVC-Livestock utilizes anchor firms as conduits through which the program engages the broader sector—from suppliers to individual producers: Afghanistan’s farmers. The growth of the anchor firms promotes efficiency and profitability, and strengthens the entire Afghan livestock value chain with a direct and positive impact on the economy, households, and livelihoods.

AVC-Livestock assists vulnerable farm communities and households severely impacted by continued regional droughts, climate change, and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program also supports activities designed to increase the domestic production of food, as imports become increasingly costly.
