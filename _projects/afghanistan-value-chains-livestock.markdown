Over the past 15 years, Afghanistan has developed a countrywide network of agricultural input suppliers, farmers have embraced improved technologies, and a cadre of agricultural produce retailers and exporters has begun to emerge. However, high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and a poor enabling environment have created excessive market risks for agribusinesses. These challenges deter private investment in livestock-related enterprises and hinder growth in the agriculture sector overall.

The Afghanistan Value Chains–Livestock (AVC-Livestock) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, takes a [market systems](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/market-systems-development-a-primer-on-pro-poor-programming/) approach to identifying and removing constraints to growth in the livestock sector. The project offers management consulting to promising anchor firms to help them expand into domestic and international markets, attract private investment, and improve the business-enabling environment. By increasing productivity for farmers and businesses working in poultry, sheep, dairy, and other value chains, AVC-Livestock helps raise incomes for thousands of households and create jobs for men, women, and young people.
