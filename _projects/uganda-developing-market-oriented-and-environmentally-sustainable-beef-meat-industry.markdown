This programme contributes to a competitive, profitable, job-intensive, gender-responsive, and environmentally sustainable agricultural sector in Uganda. Our team uses a value chain approach in targeted areas to boost the overall performance—such as production volume, quality, value addition, increased employment, and environmental sustainability—of the meat sector.

We bring together public and private players with smallholder farmers and beef-related agriculture firms to promote an environmentally sustainable, climate-resilient, low-emission, local, and regional meat industry. 

The project helps create producer groups—including women groups—that raise standards of beef production: promoting animal disease control and prevention, offering training on climate-smart pasture and manure management, promoting integrated water management, and encouraging supplementary feeding and efficient breeding methods (practices that can reduce greenhouse gas production). 

The project also improves marketing and transportation to stimulate demand for safer meat processing and animal welfare practices. The project is assessing options for improving local slaughter facilities and partnering with urban women’s groups to generate income from cooked beef products.

## Sample Activities

* Review and update all policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks, including standards, guidelines, and best practices along the beef value chain, with a particular focus on including women and mitigating environmental impact.
* Help formulate producer groups that can work closely to raise standards of beef production that is environmentally sustainable.
* Improve marketing and transportation of beef.

## Select Results
