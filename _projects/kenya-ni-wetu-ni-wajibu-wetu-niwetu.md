Kenya is one of Africa’s longest-running democracies, a regional economic powerhouse, and a critical ally in the fight against violent extremism. After Kenyan troops entered Somalia in 2011 under Operation Linda Nchi (“Protect the Country”), the terrorist group Al-Shabaab and its Kenyan affiliate al-Hijra have reacted by carrying out increasingly audacious attacks on targets within Kenya, including assaults on buses, churches, mosques, shopping malls, and universities. The escalating violence has in turn exacerbated existing tensions between Kenyan Christians and Muslim populations, which extremist groups take advantage of to fuel their victimization narratives and recruit disenfranchised individuals to their cause.

In response to this growing extremist threat, the Ni Wetu Ni Wajibu Wetu (NIWETU) program was launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development to empower Kenyan communities and government institutions to take the lead on countering violent extremism (CVE). NIWETU will work to address the root causes of extremism by fostering a sense of unity and tolerance among individuals, communities, and civil society groups, as well as provide CVE training to government institutions at the county and national levels. “Ni Wetu Ni Wajibu Wetu” is a Kiswahili phrase meaning “We are responsible,” and is inspired by verses in the Kenyan national anthem and the Constitution of Kenya.

DAI will use a tested complex adaptive systems approach to implement NIWETU, which recognizes that both drivers for violent extremism, as well as champions against it exist in a complex, ever-changing environment with multiple actors, decision makers, and influencers. By examining not only individual motivators, but also the political, social, and economic factors that can either exacerbate or mitigate violent extremism, NIWETU work to direct program interventions where they will have the most significant and lasting impact.

## Sample Activities

* Enhance community mobilization to address motivators of violent extremism.

* Build the capacity of community leaders and groups to work effectively with one another across ethnic and religious lines.

* Help local community organizations to detect early signs of radicalization and address them before they escalate.

* Support specific government officials at the national and local level who can positively affect outcomes through CVE capacity enhancement.

* Partner with national government stakeholders, including the National Counter Terrorism Centre, the National Steering Committee on Peace Building and Conflict Management, and others, to discuss priority areas for support and how to build relationships and trust between communities and the government.
