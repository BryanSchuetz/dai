summary: One of the most important political, social, and economic challenges facing
  Palestine today is the lack of sustainable and productive employment opportunities
  for the state’s growing population. Creating more jobs for women, youth, and marginalized
  people in particular is seen as one of the most effective paths toward reducing
  overall poverty in Palestine.

Palestine lacks sustainable and productive employment opportunities for the state’s growing population. Creating jobs would reduce poverty and improve quality of life, but many companies have been cut off from direct market contact and cannot find financing, limiting their ability to compete, grow, and add jobs. In addition, Palestine’s insecure business environment with high costs and risks has deterred outside private investment, while a breakdown of trust and dialogue between the private sector and Palestinian Authority has undermined innovation and growth.

Implemented by DAI on behalf of the Palestinian Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP), the Finance for Jobs project (F4J) addresses constraints to job growth. F4J is the first in an anticipated series of projects to mobilize private investment and create jobs in the West Bank and Gaza by deploying innovative financing instruments.
