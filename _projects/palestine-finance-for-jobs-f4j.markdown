One of the most important political, social, and economic challenges facing Palestine today is the lack of sustainable and productive employment opportunities for the state’s growing population. Creating more jobs for women, youth, and marginalized people in particular is seen the most effective paths towards reducing overall poverty in Palestine. However, many companies have been cut off from direct market contact and cannot find financing, leading them to rely on outdated business models that limit their ability to compete, grow, and add new jobs. In addition, Palestine’s insecure business environment with high risks and high costs has deterred outside private investment, while a breakdown of trust and dialogue between the private sector and the Palestinian Authority has undermined innovation and growth.

The Palestine Finance for Jobs (F4J) project, funded by the World Bank, seeks to overcome these fundamental barriers by investing in an enterprise finance mobilization ecosystem and business growth initiatives. F4J will collaborate with organizations in developing and testing innovative instruments that increase access to the private financing needed to help stimulate economic growth and drive job creation, including piloting the first development impact bond (DIB) to be used in Palestine.

Our approach to F4J will promote cross-sector employment by providing coordinated matching grants that allow entire vertical pipelines of companies to grow together and create jobs. F4J will also work closely with investment funds, businesses, and government agencies to generate proof-of-concept results in the first year and use lessons learned in scaling up early successes for wider implementation.

**Sample Activities**

* Solicit proposals from investment funds for cost-shared financing to improve performance of their enterprises and assist selected funds in enhancing their overall pipeline of invested businesses.

* Work with DIB advising firm partner to build a financial model for the bond that most efficiently meets the needs of the Palestinian Authority, service providers, employers, and investors, as well identify potential DIB investors.

* Develop a social cost-benefit analysis tool to assist the Ministry of Finance and Planning and private-sector stakeholders in identifying industries and business with high job creation potential for investment.
