In 2011, the European Union and the Government of Liberia concluded a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) under the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan.

In the same year, the Liberian government committed to developing and implementing systems to ensure that its timber exports to the European Union are legally produced. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) further commits Liberia to reform its governance to secure the long-term sustainability of Liberia's forest sector while contributing to national economic development. The U.K. Department for International Development and the European Commission agreed to provide long-term support to Liberia to enable it to meet its VPA obligations.

In 2013, we were hired to establish and manage a VPA Support Unit to work with the Forestry Development Authority, the Liberian Implementation Committee, and relevant private sector and civil society organisations.
