* Build the capacity of targeted civil society organizations to participate in issue-based reforms and in measures to increase accountability and social inclusion.
* Promote development of existing domestic providers of capacity building services.
* Use monitoring and iterative evaluation to ensure that our learning is shared with others and our best practices are applied by others and sustainable.

###  Select Results

* Provided funding and support to government agencies that oversee natural resource management for community outreach activities.
* Launched the LAVI Learning Lab, a co-working space, technology hub, and online community dedicated to information-sharing and collaborative problem-solving to promote issue-based reform. 
* Identified and trained a pool of 18 Liberian small businesses, consulting firms, and experienced nongovernmental organizations to function as service providers to address capacity challenges.
