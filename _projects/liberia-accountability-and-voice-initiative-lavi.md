The team works with civil society, the private sector, government, and others to support these coalitions—strengthening linkages among them, building capacity, and promoting local services.

* Build the capacity of targeted civil society organizations to participate in issue-based reforms and in measures to increase accountability and social inclusion.

* Use monitoring and iterative evaluation to ensure that our learning is shared with others and our best practices are applied by others and sustainable.

###  Select Results

	Supported eight local CSOs in the formation of an advocacy coalition to promote reforms in the management and monitoring of the County Social Developent Funds (CSDF), money earmarked in concession agreements for community development projects in counties where natural resource extraction companies operate. The CSOs are currently implementing the campaign across the country which includes activities such as  trainings for journalists in reporting on the CSDF, the creation of scorecards to facilitate citizen monitoring of CSDF management, and a national multi-stakeholder dialogue to create linkages between diverse actors and include citizens in CSDF policy reform process.
	Provided funding and support to government agencies that oversee natural resource management (NRM) for community outreach activities including the popularizing of simplified concession agreements and hosting of town hall meetings to discuss social obligations of concession companies to surrounding communities
	Launched the LAVI Learning Lab, a co-working space, technology hub, and online community dedicated to information-sharing and collaborative problem-solving to promote issue-based reform. At the Lab, LAVI and its learning partners will host events to share and capture advocacy best practices related to NRM issues in Liberia
	Identified and trained a pool of eighteen Liberian small businesses, consulting firms, and experienced NGOs to function as service providers who will address capacity challenges among CSOs and build up the local capacity development market
	Conducted a national mobile survey and regional focus group discussions to determine which policy issues are priorties for Liberians. This process informed the selection of education as LAVI’s Second Thematic Window.
