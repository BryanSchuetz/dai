In 2000, the U.S. Congress formally established microenterprise development as an integral part of U.S. foreign assistance strategy. DAI manages Microenterprise Results Reporting (MRR) for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

With a partner web development firm, we maintain the MRR website, an integrated web-based database to collect and process accurate, timely information from missions and partners on funding, results, and other requirements ([www.mrreporting.org][1]).

We have also been increasingly successful in capturing and reporting on USAID funding and results related to previously unreported kinds of microenterprise development support, such as support to crop production microenterprises.

###  Sample Activities

* Collect and analyze funding data on USAID's global investments and impact in microenterprise development as required by Congress.
* Produce USAID's annual Microenterprise Results Report to Congress and respond to inquiries about USAID's microenterprise investments through data analysis and reporting.
* Report aggregate Poverty Assessment Tool results annually to Congress.

###  Select Results

* Significantly minimized the reporting burden on reporting partners by streamlining the process.
* Improved the user experience on the website.
* Updated the partner-level results survey to reflect USAID's more current, integrated approach to microenterprise development and economic growth.
