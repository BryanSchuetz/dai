The Local Impact Governance Activity (Local Impact) capitalizes on the momentum of recent policy initiatives and builds a sustainable foundation for devolved service delivery in Zambia. By supporting the transformation of subnational governance to be more responsive to citizen needs, Local Impact will leverage the U.S. Agency for International Development’s previous gains in transparency and accountability, health, education, and economic growth to help the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) improve both the enabling environment and development outcomes critical to advancing self-reliance. With national and local elections in August 2021, Local Impact will ensure that decentralization delivers on its promise.
 
The challenges to fulfilling the vision of decentralization include misalignment between national and local authorities, uneven capacity and characteristics of subnational actors, a constrained fiscal environment, and limited government-citizen collaboration. Although Zambia began devolving functions and administrative powers to districts in 2015, five years later, councils have yet to be empowered to deliver health, education, and economic development: funding for the devolved sectors remain with sector line ministries. Likewise, the natural resource management sector requires harmonization of policies (on forests, urban planning, water, wildlife) before councils can take on these responsibilities.
