The Critical Infrastructure Digitalization and Resilience (CIDR) activity assists countries of the Western Balkans, Black Sea Region, and South Caucasus to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the legal, workforce, and investment needs that support cybersecurity of infrastructure.

Working with host governments, infrastructure operators, and their partners, CIDR aims to help countries raise the quality of their cybersecurity through country-led programs. This support assists critical infrastructure systems such as energy, telecommunications, and e-services to be defended from cyberattacks and resilient so they can continue to provide citizens with essential services. 

## Sample Activities
