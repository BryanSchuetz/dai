DAI supports the Government of Zambia to reduce stunting among children under 2 years of age. The first phase of Zambia’s [Scaling Up Nutrition](https://scalingupnutrition.org/) program launched in 2011 and covered 14 districts; [this phase](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-to-launch-usaid-zambia-program-to-reduce-stunting-in-young-children) expands activities to 30 districts covering 7.1 million people, including 850,000 children under age 2 and their mothers.

Zambia SUN TA layers interventions in nutrition, health, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), building the capacity of Zambian counterparts at all levels to take these interventions forward. The Zambian government is committed to high-impact, nutrition-specific, and nutrition-sensitive interventions. The consortium collaborates with Zambia’s National Food and Nutrition Council (NFNC), ministry representatives, donors, district health workers, and sanitation service providers, among others. DAI’s consortium includes TechnoServe, EXP Zambia, Toilet Yanga, and Viamo.

[Stunting](https://www.who.int/nutrition/healthygrowthproj_stunted_videos/en/) is impaired growth and development that children experience as a result of poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Affecting 40 percent of Zambian children under age 5, stunting can cause poor cognition and educational performance and other harmful lifelong effects. Zambia SUN TA works to ensure that more of Zambia’s children grow up healthy, strong, and productive.

## Sample Activities

* Build the capacity of district- and ward-level staff to plan and coordinate demand-driven interventions in nutrition, health, agriculture, and WASH.
* Collaborate with partners to assess local barriers and opportunities in areas such as WASH and food value chains, communications and messaging strategies, and uses of digital technology.
* Capture knowledge from across districts and develop constituencies for sharing lessons learned and best practices to increase uptake of successes and decrease the use of less-effective efforts.
