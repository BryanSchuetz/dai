Zambia SUN TA will support the Government of Zambia in its efforts to reduce stunting among children under two years of age by layering interventions in nutrition, health, water, sanitation, and agriculture, and building the capacity of Zambian counterparts at all levels to take these interventions forward. Together, this will address the objective of sustained adequate quantity and quality of dietary intake among target groups and adequate health conditions for biological utilization of nutrients.

The Zambian government is committed to high-impact, nutrition-specific, and nutrition-sensitive interventions. By decreasing stunting, Zambia SUN TA will help assure that more of Zambia’s children grow up healthy, strong, and productive. 

The project team collaborates with Zambia’s National Food and Nutrition Council, ministry representatives, donors, district health workers, and sanitation service providers, among others. The DAI-led consortium includes TechnoServe, EXP Zambia, Toilet Yanga, and Viamo.

### Sample Activities

* Review districts to identify areas of common need and create economies of scale for capacity building, behavior change, and improved service delivery;
* Deploy teams to provide demand-driven assistance to capacity gaps at all levels;
* Leverage technology such as mobile data collection and interactive voice response to broaden reach, deepen coverage, and provide feedback loops that allow for real-time adaptive management.
