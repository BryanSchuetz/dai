DAI will support the Government of Zambia to reduce stunting among children under 2 years of age. The first phase of Zambia’s [Scaling Up Nutrition](https://scalingupnutrition.org/) program launched in 2011 and covered 14 districts; this phase will expand activities to 30 districts covering 7.1 million people, including 850,000 children under 2 and their mothers.

Zambia SUN TA will layer interventions in nutrition, health, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), building the capacity of Zambian counterparts at all levels to take these interventions forward. The consortium will collaborate with Zambia’s National Food and Nutrition Council (NFNC), ministry representatives, donors, district health workers, and sanitation service providers, among others. DAI’s consortium includes TechnoServe, EXP Zambia, Toilet Yanga, and Viamo.

The Zambian government is committed to high-impact, nutrition-specific, and nutrition-sensitive interventions. The Zambia SUN TA team is collaborating with Zambia’s National Food and Nutrition Council (NFNC), ministry representatives, donors, district health workers, and sanitation service providers, among others. DAI’s consortium includes TechnoServe, EXP Zambia, Toilet Yanga, and Viamo.

[Stunting](https://www.who.int/nutrition/healthygrowthproj_stunted_videos/en/) is impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Affecting 40 percent of Zambian children under age five, stunting can cause poor cognition and educational performance and other harmful lifelong effects. Zambia SUN TA will ensure that more of Zambia’s children grow up healthy, strong, and productive.

### Sample Activities

* Build capacity of district- and ward-level staff to plan and coordinate demand-driven interventions in nutrition, health, agriculture, and WASH.
* Collaborate with partners to assess local barriers and opportunities in areas such as WASH and food value chains, communications and messaging strategies, and uses of digital technology.
* Capture knowledge from across districts and develop constituencies for sharing lessons learned and best practices to increase uptake of successes and decrease use of less-effective efforts.
