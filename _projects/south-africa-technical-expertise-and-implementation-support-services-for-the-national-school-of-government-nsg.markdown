The National School of Government (NSG) in South Africa contributes to the establishment of a capable, professional, and responsive public sector that is committed to, and has institutionalized, the values and policies of a developmental state. The NSG plays a critical role as it is committed to building the professionalization of public service through learning and development interventions.

With this technical assistance project, DAI assists the NSG in fulfilling its mandate as well as furthering the depth of what that mandate involves. Our intervention strengthens the NSG as a training institution, rolling out three important training programmes (Breaking Barriers to Entry, Compulsory Induction, and Reorientation programmes), and strengthens the network and collaborations of the NSG in an effort to create new opportunities for the school and its beneficiaries.
