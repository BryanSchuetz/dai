Partnership for Learning for All in Nigeria (PLANE) is a seven-year education Program, funded by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). It aims to support and realize the Government of Nigeria’s commitment to delivering sustainable improvements in learning outcomes for all of Nigeria’s children. 

The program engages with state and non-state actors within the basic education sub-sector to strengthen systems for improved delivery of inclusive, good-quality foundational learning, with a focus on marginalized groups, especially girls and children with disabilities. It will contribute to transformational change, enabling the delivery of effective and efficient educational services at scale to improve learning outcomes. 
 
PLANE works at the federal level and in five states (Kaduna, Kano, Jigawa, Yobe, and Borno) with legislators, state and non-state education providers, civil society organizations, teachers' unions, community leaders, learners, and parents. It also works in two regions: the southeast and southwest.

The program’s anticipated impact is significant and far-reaching, with the potential to reach up to eight million children. It aims to enhance teaching and learning for approximately 1.5 million children. Additionally, PLANE's initiatives in education during emergencies are expected to benefit around 600,000 children. By targeting various aspects of the education landscape, PLANE seeks to lay the foundation for improved learning outcomes, increased accessibility, and enhanced educational quality for generations to come.

## Sample Activities

* Embedding the use of data and evidence within the education system.
* Supporting government system strengthening and helping unlock governance bottlenecks for better education service delivery.
* Supporting the improvements in the regulation of the non-state sector.
* Working with community structures and improving the inclusion and learning of marginalized children, especially girls and children with disabilities.
* Supporting the education of children affected by conflict.

## Select Results

* Made key advancements on eight systemic education reforms in Nigeria, potentially benefitting over 8 million children.
* Supported the Kano, Kaduna, and Jigawa state governments in Nigeria to provide teaching and learning materials.

Results showed that 36.4 percent of children in Foundational Learning schools increased a level in Hausa literacy, while 47.1 percent increased a level in maths.
* Reached 9,385 teachers and 554,648 learners with foundational learning and accelerated learning materials.
* Supported community leaders and LGEAs in identifying and establishing 200 community learning hubs to increase education awareness and provide learning opportunities within selected communities.
* PLANE has catalyzed links between the financial sector and non-state schools, enabling greater financial stability and growth opportunities for education providers.
