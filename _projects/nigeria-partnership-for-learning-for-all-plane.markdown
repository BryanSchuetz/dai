The Partnership for Learning for All in Nigeria (PLANE) project works to deliver a more inclusive and effective education system and improve learning outcomes for students in their pre-primary and primary years. 

PLANE focuses on improving basic education and tackling fundamental system constraints: raising the quality of teaching and learning for foundational skills while supporting improvements in school management and teaching colleges; supporting the state education sector through policy formulation, budgeting, and management reforms; and unlocking governance bottlenecks to support improvements in frontline education delivery. 
 
In partnership with our key subcontractor FHI360, PLANE operates across Kano, Kaduna, Jigawa, the South East and South West regions, and in the federal capital territory to improve regulation and accountability of both the state and non-state sector, fostering better collaboration and connectivity and promoting successful models that contribute to innovation.

## Sample Activities

* Improve teaching and learning in performance-focused schools and colleges—leading to the use of evidence-based teaching and learning approaches and better management.
* Assist stakeholders in upgrading their systems to better incorporate human and financial resources, ultimately allowing them to run their operations more efficiently. Better-managed systems should lead to better results for students.
