With the Lebanese economy in turmoil—exports and imports have dropped sharply, unemployment has surged, and incomes have dropped—the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Trade and Investment Facilitation (TIF) Program works to boost the exports of Lebanese goods and services, facilitate investment in Lebanese enterprises, and improve the business and investment enabling environment in Lebanon.
 
TIF’s priority sectors are tourism, agriculture and agrifoods, manufacturing, and the knowledge economy, with opportunities to be identified quickly based on a sector mapping exercise. TIF aims to generate more than $800 million in sales for Lebanese enterprises and leverage $270 million in private sector investment.
