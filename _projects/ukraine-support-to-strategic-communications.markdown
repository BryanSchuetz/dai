In 2019, European integration was included as a strategic priority in Ukraine’s Constitution. Since then, Ukrainian governments implement reforms and develop plans to be further integrated into the EU. Such ambitious reform programmes must be supported by citizens, and strategic communications is key to ensure their success. Despite significant efforts, Ukraine still suffers from low level of public trust in public institutions that slow down the reform process and reduce the government's ability to fight external campaigns aimed at destabilising its sovereignty. 

The current project aims at increasing capacities for Strategic Communication of the Ukrainian Government, with the overall objective to ensure awareness and understanding of reform processes throughout the country, and fight disinformation. Our project team works with public administrations to strengthen their capacities to design, launch, assess and adapt communication campaign for local, national and international audiences. 

Sample activities
-	Conduct trainings for Ukrainian public administration staff 
-	Develop a platform to collect resources on countering disinformation
-	Develop a communication toolbox
-	Organise annual workshops on best practices for strategic communications
-	Mentor at least 8 regional or sub-regional communication campaigns
-	Provide advise and assistance in crisis communication campaigns
