In 2019, European integration was included as a strategic priority in Ukraine’s Constitution. Since then, the Ukrainian government has implemented reforms and developed plans to be further integrated into the European Union. Ambitious reform programmes must be supported by citizens—and strategic communications are key to ensuring public buy-in.

DAI's project works to increase the strategic communications capacity of the Ukrainian Government, with an overall objective of ensuring the public's awareness and understanding of reform processes throughout the country, and fight disinformation. Our team works with public administrations to strengthen their capacities to design, launch, assess, and adapt communications campaigns for local, national, and international audiences.
