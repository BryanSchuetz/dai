DAI is improving the capacity of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat to provide expertise and harmonise policies and strategies for regional integration and sustainable development for its member states: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

The Secretariat's mandate includes strategic planning and management, implementing decisions, organising and managing meetings, finance and general administration, representation, and promotion.

###  Sample Activities

* Implement and institutionalise executive-led change management of all directorates and units, including collecting baseline information/data on organisational health, and developing a roadmap for change management and dashboard for programme monitoring and decision making.
* Strengthen capacity of the Secretariat to manage programmes and associated implementation instruments.
* Assure compliance of structures and systems with internationally accepted practices in accounting, procurement, audit, and human resources management and administration.

###  Select Results

* Trained the Secretariat on revised procurement policies, supply chain management, and contract administration.
* Prepared the SADC to work directly with international donors to manage projects.
* Teamed with SADC directorates to improve evaluation guidelines and build capacity between personnel responsible for monitoring and planning.
* Developed program dashboards to track projects and created statistical yearbooks to support data-driven planning.
* Strengthened legitimacy by enabling the SADC to call out members not fulfilling their obligations.
* Aligned human resources policies—including job descriptions, hiring standards, and performance reviews—to align them with SADC vision and values.
