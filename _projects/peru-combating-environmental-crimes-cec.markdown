The Combating Environmental Crimes (CEC) project is a five-year initiative to help Peruvian institutions and actors more effectively manage the country’s natural resources for future generations. CEC aims to sustainably transform the culture of rule of law and citizen stewardship when it comes to protecting Peru’s environmental assets.  

Taking a local systems approach, DAI will ensure that CEC leaves behind:
 
* Strong environmental monitoring and enforcement capabilities.
* Better, more widespread understanding of the shared value of natural resources and the extensive costs—economic, ecological, cultural, and security-related—of their degradation.
* Clearer, reinforced linkages demonstrating that effective environmental justice leads to tangible economic and social benefits for all Peruvians.
* An environmental justice system that more fully engages and represents the interests, capabilities, and contributions of women and indigenous communities.
