title: 'Worldwide—Expert Advisory Call Down Services (EACDS) Lot B: Strengthening
  Resilience and Response to Crises'
date: 2017-03-04 02:41:00 Z
summary: Crises such as natural disasters, violent conflicts, and disease outbreaks
  continue to affect large numbers of people across the world, with long-term stresses
  such as climate change making extreme weather events more common and sapping the
  reserves of disaster-affected communities. Such strains have resulted in increased
  migration, unstable states, protracted humanitarian interventions, and expensive
  rebuilding efforts. In addition to the toll of human suffering, the costs associated
  with responding to such crises can strain the entire humanitarian response system,
  while subsequent regional instability can develop into security threats with far-reaching
  consequences.

Crises such as natural disasters, violent conflicts, and disease outbreaks continue to affect large numbers of people across the world, with long-term stresses such as climate change making extreme weather events more common and sapping the reserves of disaster-affected communities. Such strains have resulted in increased migration, unstable states, protracted humanitarian interventions, and expensive rebuilding efforts. In addition to the toll of human suffering, the costs associated with responding to such crises can strain the entire humanitarian response system, while subsequent regional instability can develop into security threats with far-reaching consequences.

To better assist the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people to deal with shocks, adapt to change, and mitigate risk, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) has designed the Expert Advisory Call Down Services (EACDs) Lot B: Strengthening Resilience and Response to Crises. EACDs is a technical advisory call down service which provides rapid-response, expert support to DFID and other U.K. Government agencies and other donors. In managing Lot B, DAI will lead a 63-member consortium to respond to the varied requirements of service users-both to help them make risk-aware investments that take into account relevant future hazards, and to provide analysis and practical expertise to respond to crises where they occur. The service will also focus on synthesising and sharing lessons learned in cross-sectoral resilience building and crisis mitigation with U.K. Government stakeholders and the wider donor community. A strong emphasis will be placed on bridging the divide between humanitarian action and development by planning for shocks and stresses and ensuring that emergency responses do not ignore or disrupt development paths.

**Sample Activities**

* Respond  to on-demand requests for support and work with users to precisely define scopes of assistance from first idea to full terms of reference.

* Assist in identifying learning and communication opportunities and promoting gender inclusion standards across all work.

* Rapidly source expertise from across a consortium of more than 60 partners or other specialist suppliers, often within a 10-day period.

* Manage all commissioned assignments on behalf of DFID, including contract placement and management, financial management, delivery and quality control, and duty of care.

* Promote learning materials for a wider audience through digital communications and social media.
