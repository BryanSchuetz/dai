Crises such as natural disasters, violent conflicts, and disease outbreaks continue to affect more and more people across the world, resulting in increased migration, unstable states, protracted humanitarian interventions, and expensive rebuilding efforts. In addition to the toll of human suffering, the costs associated with responding to such crises can strain the entire humanitarian response system, while subsequent regional instability can develop into security threats with far-reaching consequences.

To better assist the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people to deal with shocks, adapt to change, and mitigate risk, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) has designed the Expert Advisory Call Down Services (EACDs) – Lot B: Strengthening Resilience and Response to Crises. EACDs is a technical advisory call down service which will providing rapid-response, expert support to DFID and other UK government agencies in the implementation of UK aid strategy. In supporting Lot B, DAI will lead a 63-member consortium in working with DFID and its new knowledge management service, K4D, to synthesise and share lessons learnt in cross-sectoral resilience building and crisis mitigation. A strong emphasis will be placed on bridging the divide between humanitarian action and development by planning for shocks and stresses and ensuring that emergency responses do not ignore or disrupt development paths.
