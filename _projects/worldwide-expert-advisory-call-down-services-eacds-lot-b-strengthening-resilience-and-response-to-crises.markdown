Crises such as natural disasters, violent conflicts, and disease outbreaks continue to affect large numbers of people across the world, with long-term stresses such as climate change making extreme weather events more common and sapping the reserves of disaster-affected communities. Such strains have resulted in increased migration, unstable states, protracted humanitarian interventions, and expensive rebuilding efforts. In addition to the toll of human suffering, the costs associated with responding to such crises can strain the entire humanitarian response system, while subsequent regional instability can develop into security threats with far-reaching consequences.

To better assist the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people to deal with shocks, adapt to change, and mitigate risk, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) has designed the Expert Advisory Call Down Services (EACDS) Lot B: Strengthening Resilience and Response to Crises. EACDS is a technical advisory call down service which provides rapid-response, expert support to DFID and other U.K. Government agencies and other donors. In managing Lot B, DAI will lead a 63-member consortium to respond to the varied requirements of service users-both to help them make risk-aware investments that take into account relevant future hazards, and to provide analysis and practical expertise to respond to crises where they occur. The service will also focus on sharing lessons learned in cross-sectoral resilience building and crisis mitigation with U.K. Government stakeholders and the wider donor community. A strong emphasis will be placed on bridging the divide between humanitarian action and development by planning for shocks and stresses and ensuring that emergency responses do not ignore or disrupt development paths.
