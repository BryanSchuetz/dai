ABADE worked to increase domestic and foreign investment, stimulate employment, and improve sales of Afghan products. By funding Afghan businesses that have viable plans and matching funds, ABADE helped these businesses mitigate the financial risk inherent to investing, expanding, and innovating.

[ABADE][1] had three components: 1) awarding and managing grants to small and medium businesses and business alliances to support effective planning and innovative ideas, 2) providing technical assistance and business advice, and 3) improving the business enabling environment. Working under a subcontract to IESC, DAI lead the[ third component ][2]by addressing regulatory and procedural barriers, particularly those identified by our partner businesses and alliances.

###  Sample Activities

* Conduct assessments and analytical studies driven by the grant applicants.
* Assist relevant ministries by drafting policy memoranda and regulatory guidelines for specific industries.
