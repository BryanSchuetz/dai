The Promoting Sustainable Agricultural Market System (PROMAS) project aims to create a more competitive, inclusive, climate-resilient market in northern Mozambique. The team is applying a market systems approach to increase the income and employment opportunities of male and female smallholder farmers, youth, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 
 
Partnering with Swiss development organization Helvetas, DAI is working to achieve the following outcomes: 
1. Enhanced productivity of SHF with a special focus on women and youth
2. Better functioning agriculture input and output markets for SHF and MSMEs in peri-urban and rural areas
3. Greater availability of adequate risk management and related instruments for smallholder farmers to absorb climate change shocks
4. Policies and regulations conducive to inclusive agricultural value chain development.
 
In line with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) principles of long-term engagement, the project has an overall implementation period of almost 12 years. Upon successful delivery of this one-year inception phase, DAI will manage the four-year Phase 1. PROMAS will draw on an unrivalled knowledge base gained through our delivery of [InovAgro](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-innovation-agribusiness-inovagro), SDC’s flagship market systems project—to ensure PROMAS interventions deliver sustainable, high-impact results in northern Mozambique.

### Sample Activities 

* Carry out a climate risk and adaptation assessment, to identify priority risks and identify interventions to help farmers adapt to present and future climate challenges.
* Examine the incentives for input suppliers and agro-dealers to map out and promote crop varieties that are appropriate to the different agroecological zones. 
* Examine the extent to which climate adaptation practices such as conservation farming, crop rotation, use of drought-resistant and short-season seed varieties are practiced, and identify means to incentivise market partners to promote them. 
* Engage with the National Seed Authority to explore options for PSSI sustainability. 
* Examine opportunities to promote inter- and intra-sector dialogues (seeds, output markets, finance) to establish platforms with the capacity to lobby and advocate for factors that affect their sectors to provincial and national government. 
* Explore modalities for big buyers to drive CATs inclusion as formal suppliers, including capacity-building CATs to formalise their businesses and offer trade finance. 
* Explore feedback mechanisms from end-buyers and CATs to seed companies and farmers to produce varieties with market demand. 
* Expand financial products for agribusiness MSMEs with GAPI and Banco Futuro, InovAgro partners, and Absa.
