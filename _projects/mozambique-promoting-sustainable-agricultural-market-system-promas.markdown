The Promoting Sustainable Agricultural Market System (PROMAS) project is creating a more competitive, inclusive, climate-resilient market in northern Mozambique. The team applies a [market systems approach](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/value-chain-and-market-systems-development) to increase the income and employment opportunities of male and female smallholder farmers, youth, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 
 
Partnering with Swiss development organization Helvetas, DAI is working to: enhance the productivity of smallholder farmers with a special focus on women and young people; improve agriculture input and output markets for smallholder farmers and MSMEs in peri-urban and rural areas; increase the availability of adequate risk management and related instruments for smallholder farmers to absorb climate change shocks; and develop policies and regulations conducive to inclusive agricultural value chain development.
 
In line with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) principles of long-term engagement, the project runs for almost 12 years. Upon successful delivery of this one-year inception phase, DAI will manage the four-year phase 1. PROMAS draws upon an unrivaled knowledge base gained the DAI-led [InovAgro project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-innovation-agribusiness-inovagro), SDC’s flagship market systems project—to ensure PROMAS interventions deliver sustainable, high-impact results in northern Mozambique.

## Sample Activities 

* Carry out a climate risk and adaptation assessment to identify priority risks and identify interventions to help farmers adapt to present and future climate challenges.
* Examine the incentives for input suppliers and agro-dealers to map out and promote crop varieties that are appropriate to the different agroecological zones. 
* Examine the extent to which climate adaptation practices such as conservation farming, crop rotation, use of drought-resistant and short-season seed varieties are practiced, and identify means to incentivize market partners to promote them. 
* Engage with the National Seed Authority to explore options for sustainability. 
* Examine opportunities to promote inter- and intra-sector dialogues (seeds, output markets, finance) to establish platforms with the capacity to lobby and advocate for factors that affect their sectors to provincial and national government. 
* Expand financial products for agribusiness MSMEs.
