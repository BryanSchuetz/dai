While there is some quite good quality economic policy research in and around Zambia, most people, including policy makers, don't know about it. ZEAP aims to raise the quality of research and how it is communicated and improve the ways in which it is used for advocacy. The intended outcome is more and better public debate with the expectation that this will lead to better economic policy and, in turn, more wealth creation and poverty alleviation.

Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), ZEAP also supports the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), a long established association of business, banking, academic, and government representatives. The organisation is well placed to use its senior network to spread informed messages regarding economic policy.

The topics of importance for policy debate in Zambia need to be chosen by Zambians. ZEAP advises its think tank partners about how to choose subjects which are relevant to the country's own interests and priorities, consistent with the think tank's own agenda, and which will attract interest from those who are well placed to influence policy.

###  Sample Activities

* Support high-quality research.
* Promote better publicity and advocacy around research results.
* Strengthen capacity amongst partner think tanks to deliver these results.
