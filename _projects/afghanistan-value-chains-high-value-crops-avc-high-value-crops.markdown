Afghanistan’s agriculture sector has emerged as a powerful driver of the national economy. With steady growth over the past 15 years, farmers, input suppliers, processors, and traders are now prepared to transform loosely organized agricultural value chains into efficient and competitive value-creating systems. However, challenges such as high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and insufficient coordination constrain the Afghan agriculture sector from reaching its full potential.

The Afghanistan Value Chains–High Value Crops (AVC–High Value Crops) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, takes a market systems approach to improving productivity and profitability in select agriculture value chains by working with leading Afghan firms. DAI provides management consulting services to such “anchor” firms in fruit and nuts, high-value horticulture, and spices and medicinal crops value chains to address market failures, strengthen linkages, drive growth, and create jobs for men, women, and youth.
