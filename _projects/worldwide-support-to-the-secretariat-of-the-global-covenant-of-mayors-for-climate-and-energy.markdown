More than 10,000 cities from 138 countries across six continents—representing 21 percent of the global urban population—are signatories of the Global Covenant of Mayors (GCoM), which commits cities and local governments to implement policies and measures to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions, prepare for the impacts of climate change, increase access to sustainable energy, and track progress toward these objectives. The Global GCoM Secretariat is based in Brussels and run by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Our team provides systematic support to GCoM activities implemented by the Secretariat. DAI implements the project in consortium with partner EPU-NTUA.

### Sample Activities

* Develop coordination mechanisms to enhance global and regional coherence between the regional and national covenants and the GCoM.
* Enhance international visibility of regional and national covenants, the GCoM, and the EU leadership.
* Provide the Secretariat with policy-relevant, effective, flexible, and resource-efficient data management solutions.
* Address the need to provide GCoM services to cities in countries or regions not yet supported by Regional Secretariats.
