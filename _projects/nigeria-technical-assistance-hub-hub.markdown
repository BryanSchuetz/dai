The Technical Assistance Hub (TA Hub)—also called TAConnect—is an independent nonprofit organization that coordinates the delivery of comprehensive technical assistance and institutional strengthening support to state governments in Nigeria. TAConnect’s activities address fragmentation in the design and delivery of technical assistance to states in Nigeria, enabling increased collaboration, coordination, learning, and impact. 

The goal is for the model to be widely adopted for technical assistance provision in the country, attracting the participation of other donors, international nongovernmental groups, and funders active in Nigeria. DAI has two responsibilities: to function as a startup incubator for the TA Hub and manage its establishment; and to oversee early technical assistance deployments through the TAConnect. 

We provide consultancy support to TAConnect to mature specific strategic and operational functions of the organization such as: business plan and business development support, financial management and fiduciary responsibility strengthening, subaward management strengthening, and statutory compliance support.

We apply core principles such as continuous curation of technical assistance resources, promotion of peer learning, robust monitoring, and reliance on feedback loops, thereby ensuring that TAConnect remains relevant and responsive to its operating environment and to state government needs—with the ultimate goal of assisting state and local governments to own and sustain the systems-level improvements in service delivery.

## Sample Activities

* Serve as a demonstration of the TA Hub’s core principles—the group-antenatal care programme will assist state governments to implement and sustain group-antenatal care as part of each state’s primary healthcare system. Group-antenatal care will serve as the platform for related services such as early malaria detection and malaria treatment, and will tie into another TA Hub investment focused on strengthening the primary healthcare system’s management capacity. 
* Strengthen Nigeria's primary healthcare management capacity by improving management, operational efficiency, governance, supervision, and the quality of clinical services.
