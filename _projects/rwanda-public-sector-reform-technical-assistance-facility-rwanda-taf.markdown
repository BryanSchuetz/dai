The Rwanda Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) is a component of the Strengthening Public Financial Management and Revenue Collection (SPARC) program, which aims to support the Government of Rwanda on a range of priorities across the public sector policy-making agenda. 

The TAF will support the government in delivering the National Strategy for Transformation through the provision of short and long-term technical expertise to strengthen the quality and inclusivity of the policy-making process as critical to achieving a more effective policy response to complex development problems. The project will work with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Government of Rwanda to:

(i) Identify politically savvy technical assistance opportunities and scope their chances of successful implementation.
(ii) Manage and deliver high-quality technical assistance via short-term assignments or longer-term embedded advisory support. 
(iii) Monitor delivery and evaluate the impact of the technical assistance.
