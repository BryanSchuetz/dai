The Social Protection Technical Advice, Assistance and Resources Facility (STAAR) is a joint initiative of the U.K.’s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office’s Better Assistance in Crises (BASIC) and Gender-Responsive Social Protection (GSP) programs. The project is dedicated to expanding and improving the effectiveness of investments in both gender-responsive social protection and social protection approaches in crises. Actors from national governments, donors, and implementing partners are encouraged to access the Facility for free, with direct support from STAAR’s independent expert roster—in the form of technical assistance, specialist advice, or bespoke resources.

Why Social Protection?

Social protection reduces both poverty and inequality. Predictable access to support, when it is needed, empowers people to navigate foreseeable and unexpected risks throughout their lives. And can help them to overcome deeply ingrained inequalities.

Social Protection Approaches in Crises

Strengthening social protection systems directly benefits people living in, or at risk of crisis. Whether caused by conflict, political and economic instability, or environmental fragility. Linking traditional humanitarian assistance – which provides the bulk of support to conflict-affected communities – with social protection systems can build people’s resilience to crises and increase human capital? 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how powerful social protection can be as a tool for crisis response. It has been used by governments across the globe to help people manage the economic fall-out of the pandemic in their own lives. Critically, those countries with stronger routine social protection systems have been able to meet emerging needs more quickly and more effectively than others. 

Gender-Responsive Social Protection

Social Protection has real potential to address the drivers of gender inequality as well as poverty – closing gender gaps in education, health, and economic opportunities. To do this, systems and programs can be designed or strengthened using a gender lens – examining how each element of the system can best integrate gender equality considerations. For example, when thinking through the program design elements of the social protection system in relation to girls’ education: poverty and vulnerability assessments should map girls’ and boys’ access to and success in education; while benefits packages might include a scale-up of school feeding to maximize attention spans.
Governments, implementing partners and donors can request direct support from STAAR by contacting STAAR@STAARfacility.org. 

### Sample Activities

* Advise on the application of gender and social inclusion principles when providing social protection.
* Advise on opportunities for the social protection and humanitarian assistance nexus opportunities.
* Advise on localization: working with affected communities, community groups, local government, etc. to improve (e.g.) targeting, registration, distribution and inclusion.
* Provide policy guidance on the provision of social protection.
* Review, and support the development of, country-specific plans for social protection.
* Share evidence accrued over time and globally through country case studies, and international best practices.
