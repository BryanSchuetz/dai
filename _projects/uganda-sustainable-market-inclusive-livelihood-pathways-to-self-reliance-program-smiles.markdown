The IKEA Foundation is one of the world’s largest private funders committed to helping refugees achieve economic self-reliance and sustainable livelihoods.

The Sustainable Market Inclusive Livelihood Pathways to Self-Reliance program (SMILES) seek to address rural refugee livelihood challenges in Uganda. SMILES aims to help ultra-poor refugee and Ugandan (host community) households in the Kikuube and Kyegegwa Districts graduate from food insecurity and fragile livelihoods to self-reliance and resilience.

The project combines a graduation approach, led by AVSI, and a market systems development (MSD) approach, led by DAI to expand access to certified agri-inputs, financial services, small business training, and clean energy for refugee and host communities.

### Sample Activities

* Conduct gender, youth, climate risk, and market systems assessments in target refugee areas.

* Partner with national agri-input suppliers and buyers to expand the commercial potential of refugee and host community farmers in value chains such as maize, beans, and horticulture.

* Incentivize fintech providers to use digital platforms to partner with local refugee-led Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs).

* Build last-mile distribution networks with clean energy enterprises to expand solar pay-as-you-go business models to expand refugee livelihoods activities (such as household lighting, solar-powered irrigation, and affordable power to run a fridge in their microenterprises).

* Design randomized control trials to test new models for integrating the graduation and MSD approaches.

### Expected Results

* 21,000 refugee and host community members targeted

* 10 key market systems and value chains supported to increase sales, yield, and local job creation
