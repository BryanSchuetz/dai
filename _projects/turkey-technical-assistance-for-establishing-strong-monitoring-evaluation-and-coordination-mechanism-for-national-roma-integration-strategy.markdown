In 2017, the population of Turkey was estimated at 80.8 million with a growth rate of 1.24 percent per year. Recent studies suggest that the Roma population in Turkey ranges between 2 to 5 million and the majority of Roma live in Western Anatolia, Thrace, and in southeastern and eastern Turkey. Altogether, 22 provinces are identified as having Roma communities.

Due to the socio-economic conditions of Roma families, their access to education opportunities is relatively low. Even though enrollment in basic education is standardized and not allowing for segregation, the dropout rates and irregular attendance to school are high among the Roma children. Access to employment for Roma people is mostly difficult, lacking adequate training and education. Roma people work predominantly seasonal, temporary, or risky jobs. Inadequate housing condition is a key problem in the Roma communities living in poverty. Access to health care does not pose a serious problem as the basic health care is offered free of charge. Yet, several health problems are common
due to poverty, high-risk occupations and lack of awareness of health care facilities. Some Roma are not in the system of social insurance and are supported through social services and assistance offered.

Social inclusion of the Roma is one of priority issues in the area of social policy, reflected in the number of programmes and initiatives implemented by the Turkish government to support the Roma people. 

The EuropeAid project Technical Assistance for Establishing Strong Monitoring, Evaluation and Coordination Mechanism for National Roma Integration Strategy (for the Action Plans), led by WYG partnered with DAI’s Human Dynamics, aims to achieve measurable progress towards the full enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms by all individuals without discrimination in the area of Roma rights and strengthening respect for fundamental rights and freedoms for all individuals without discrimination in line with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the area of Roma rights in Turkey.
