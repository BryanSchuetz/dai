This programme was prompted by the post-election violence of 2007–2008 in Kenya, when implications of impunity, lack of accountability, and need for an overhaul of the constitutional, legislative, electoral, and judicial environment became critical. With DAP, the U.K. Department of International Development's ultimate goal is to improve the Kenyan Government's accountability to its citizens. We supported key reforms and built on efforts to strengthen oversight and the demand for accountability and better governance, and in doing so, helped make Kenya a more stable democracy. With our partner, the Overseas Development Institute, we supported the programme's Joint Steering Committee of donors, as well as executed and managed grants.

###  Sample Activities

* Develop a comprehensive suite of program management tools, including grant selection criteria, grant agreements, grant proposal templates, templates for budget and risk management models, and monitoring and evaluation tools.
* Assess the capacity of potential grantees, and train them on the programme's vision and goals.
* Engage the public and build coalitions at the county level to jointly plan improvements to public service delivery and strengthen formal and informal accountability mechanisms between elected country leaders and citizens.

###  Select Results

* Launched Forum Syd, a mobile phone text messaging platform, that mobilised and actively engaged more than 20,000 citizens across four counties around leadership, devolution, and public participation topics. 
* Supported partners that scrutinised legislation being developed to
improve the legal framework for fighting corruption and impunity. The success rate for their suggested amendments was high; by one count, 79 percent were reflected in the final law.
* Supported a variety of partners in producing stories on corruption and in building the capacity of investigative journalists. For example, AfriCOG produced more than 18 investigative stories, estimated to have reached more than 800,000 members of the public.
