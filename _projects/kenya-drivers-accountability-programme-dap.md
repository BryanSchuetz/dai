This programme was prompted by the post-election violence of 2007–2008 in Kenya, when implications of impunity, lack of accountability, and need for an overhaul of the constitutional, legislative, electoral, and judicial environment became critical. With DAP, the U.K. Department of International Development's ultimate goal is to improve the Kenyan Government's accountability to its citizens. We are supporting key reforms and building on efforts to strengthen oversight and the demand for accountability and better governance, and in doing so, helping make Kenya a more stable democracy. With our partner, the Overseas Development Institute, we are supporting the programme's Joint Steering Committee of donors, as well as executing and managing grants.
