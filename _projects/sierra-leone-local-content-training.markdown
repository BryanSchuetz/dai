For nearly two years, the Sustainable Business Group’s Local Content Plan and Reporting online platform has been in operation in Sierra Leone. The government’s local content regulator uses the platform to meet its obligations under the Local Content Agency Act (LCAA 2016) to track local content performance in the mining, manufacturing, ICT, agriculture, banking, and hospitality sectors. 

Company scorecards, rating their progress in meeting targets, for 2016 have been generated the first wave of 12 companies, and the inaugural annual local content performance report was delivered to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. With technical assistance from GIZ, the German aid agency, more than 50 companies and the regulatory authority have now been trained by SBG in use of the platform. The platform is now also used by the private companies in Sierra Leone that aim to fully comply with the requirements of LCAA 2016.
