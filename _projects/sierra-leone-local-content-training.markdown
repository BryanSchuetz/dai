In accordance with the provisions of the Sierra Leone Local Content Agency Act of 2016, the Sierra Leone Local Content Agency (LCA) uses the Sustainable Business Group (SBG)’s Local Content Plan and Reporting online platform to enable Sierra Leonean companies to report their local content performance data. DAI configured the software, then trained 50 companies and the regulator in the use of the portal. 

In November 2019, GIZ and the LCA engaged SBG for a second contract, to improve the reporting compliance and quality of the companies covered by the LCA’s mandate. In addition to the software subscription, SBG provides user support, training, and guidance to 36 companies operating in a wide variety of sectors: agriculture, banking, hospitality, ICT, insurance, logistics and transport, manufacturing, mining, oil, gas, and services. 

Thorough SBG’s efforts, compliance and data reporting have increased through 2020, enabling the generation of insightful semi-annual analytical local content reports for the LCA.
