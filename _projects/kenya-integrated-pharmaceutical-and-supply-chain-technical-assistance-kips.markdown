The Integrated Pharmaceutical and Supply Chain Technical Assistance (KIPS) Activity works to ensure more sustainable access to—and appropriate use of—quality-assured and affordable health commodities in Kenya by supporting the development of an increasingly resilient and mature supply chain system and pharmaceutical regulatory services. 

KIPS develops the capacity of local systems, institutions, and individuals to sustainably manage supply chains, both for U.S. Agency for International Development-procured health commodities and those procured through national and local systems. And it strengthens local pharmaceutical management systems, including high-quality pharmaceutical services and national regulatory systems.
 
Our partners on KIPS are Pamela Steele Associates, VillageReach, and US Pharmacopeia. Our key stakeholders include Kenya’s Ministry of Health Division of Health Products and Technology, county health product and technology units, the National AIDS and STI Control Program, and the National Antimicrobial Stewardship Interagency Committee, among other important stakeholders.
 
Working with these and other collaborators at the national and county level, DAI aims to bring new energy and new approaches to the process by which we collectively identify, refine, and scale sustainable solutions from among local supply chain actors and professionals across Kenya. Taking a patient-centered systems approach, KIPS nurtures a problem-solving culture that encourages continuous performance improvement among key public and private stakeholders and across all functions of the supply chain.
