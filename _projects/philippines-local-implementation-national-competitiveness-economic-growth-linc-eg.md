Implemented by the DAI/Nathan Group—a joint member of DAI and Nathan Associates Inc.—Local Implementation of National Competitivness for Economic Growth (LINC-EG) promotes local and national economic competitiveness to improve prospects for economic growth and fiscal sustainability in the Philippines. Working with local advocacy groups, the project develops policy reforms that improve Filipino private sector competitiveness, particularly in Mindanao. Although these reforms can target any level of government, the project focuses on local governments, combining our understanding of the agents and institutions involved in reforming the Philippines' political economy with a technical approach that builds ownership among local reform advocates. For example, the project includes subnational provincial competitiveness indexing.

* Streamline business permitting and licensing to enhance service delivery, and enable a full-service center with one-stop shop capabilities for business start-ups in Davao City's National Economic Research and Business Assistance Center.
