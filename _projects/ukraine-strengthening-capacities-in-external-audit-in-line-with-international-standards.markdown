Strong and efficient public financial management (PFM) is key for sustained economic growth and efficient provision of public services in Ukraine. The government adopted its 2017 PFM strategy to develop a modern system to efficiently provide public services and allocate resources to align with development priorities. 

The external audit is an explicit part of the PFM strategy. However, the organizational and institutional capacities of Ukraine’s Supreme Audit Institution, the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine (ACU), require further strengthening and development. 

This European Union project supports the ACU to reform its external audit of budgetary funds in line with the government's PFM strategy and action plan. One of the project's main goals is to strengthen the ACU’s institutional external audit capacities to be consistent with international principles and standards. Project components address legislative approximation and regulatory changes, institutional development, improvement of audit methodology, and strengthening follow-up mechanisms and communication on the main results of the ACU's work.
