DAI manages a local team partly comprised of the Parliament's Economics and Finance Committee Secretariat, and will be based in Dushanbe. DAI's project is a component of a wider programme of support by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and the World Bank to the Government of Tajikistan for improved public financial management (PFM), which includes technical assistance to ministries, the Parliament, and civil society. Our team strengthens Parliament's analysis and review of budgetary information; the availability of high-quality, evidence-based research on PFM; and engagement between Parliament and its constituents.

* Help establish constituency outreach meetings and public field hearings in various regions of Tajikistan, linking service delivery needs to the national budget.
* Provide technical assistance to develop parliamentary questions to enhance the legislature’s function in holding government to account on these issues.

### Select Results
