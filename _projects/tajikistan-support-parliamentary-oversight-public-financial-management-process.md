In the 2000s, Tajikistan experienced steady growth and poverty reduction after a decade of civil war. Nonetheless, as the global financial crisis of 2008 slowed things down and the country saw a drop of 35 percent in remittance flows—a key source of income. 

The Government of Tajikistan set out a new public finance management (PFM) reform strategy, an ambitious agenda closely tied to the country’s development strategies. The 2030 National Development Strategy reinforced calls for deeper PFM reforms, while the 2020 Mid-Term Development Programme emphasised the need to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the sector. The importance of ensuring robust scrutiny was as vital as ever.

The SPFM programme therefore came at a crucial time in supporting the national parliament, and specifically its Economics and Finance Committee (EFC), to enhance its role. When functioning effectively, parliament is a key part of the governance framework, operating at the intersection of citizen-state and executive-legislature relations, and providing a mechanism of checks and balances. SPFM, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), is strengthening the Tajikistan Parliament’s ability to fulfill its oversight responsibilities more effectively, efficiently, and accountably with regard to the management of public finances. The programme is one component of a wider portfolio of support provided by DFID and the World Bank to Tajikistan on PFM.
