The Mexico Better Health Programme, financed by the Prosperity Fund, addresses the growing threat of noncommunicable diseases—especially obesity and diabetes—with a focus on realizing the economic and social benefits associated with improved health. DAI will foster long-term links between Mexican institutions and the British National Health Service, other U.K. institutions, and networks of researchers and service providers. 

The two-year programme is designed to generate a fruitful exchange of evidence, expertise, and trade. Our partners include BMJ, the General Medical Council Service International, 2CV, The Institute for Development Studies, and Southampton University Hospital.

## Sample Activities

* Create a mechanism for long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between the United Kingdom and Mexico by developing frameworks for knowledge exchange.
* Provide a focal point through which to access high-quality, U.K.-based technical assistance.
* Support the Mexican government particularly on obesity and diabetes, and complement the government’s strengths to help it reduce health inequalities.
