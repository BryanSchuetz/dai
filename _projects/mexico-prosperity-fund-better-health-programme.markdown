The Mexico Better Health Programme, financed by the Prosperity Fund, addresses the growing threat of noncommunicable diseases—especially obesity and diabetes—with a focus on realizing the economic and social benefits associated with improved health. DAI will foster long-term links between Mexican institutions and the British National Health Service, other U.K. institutions, and networks of researchers and service providers. 

The two-year programme is designed to generate a fruitful exchange of evidence, expertise, and trade. Our partners include BMJ, the General Medical Council Service International, 2CV, The Institute for Development Studies, and Southampton University Hospital.

### Sample Activities

* Create a mechanism for long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between the United Kingdom and Mexico by developing frameworks for knowledge exchange and relationships between a range of institutions.
* Support the Mexican government to review and improve policy to address obesity and diabetes and mechanisms for measuring progress and challenges. This work will complement the government’s significant efforts to reduce health inequalities.
Support the strengthening of inclusive leadership and learning among health professionals in the Mexica health system.
Mainstream gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) at all levels of the programme, ensuring the approach is embedded within core programme activities at all levels and within the management structures and processes, ensuring the programme team has a high level of awareness of and commitment to GESI standards. The work will be based on a nuanced understanding of the cultural, political and economic context that drives current behaviour.
Conduct innovative research to understand some of the underlying social drivers of obesity in Mexico and support partnerships with the UK that will enable high quality learning for both the UK and the Mexican public health approach. For example research might explore how stress and violence links with obesity, inactivity, depression and poor eating habits, and develop integrated approaches to tackle violence and obesity
