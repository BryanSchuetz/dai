The Better Health Programme Mexico (BHPMx) is part of the U.K. Global Prosperity Fund Better Health Programme that covers eight countries. The DAI-managed programme addresses the growing incidence of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in Mexico—especially in relation to obesity and diabetes—with the aim of enhancing the economic and social benefits associated with improved health. 

The programme fosters long-term links between Mexican institutions and the National Health Service, other U.K. institutions, and networks of researchers and service providers. U.K. and Mexican partners will together build an understanding of the gendered nature of the NCD epidemic and of the severe exclusion of some groups based on ethnicity, disability, or geographical location, as well as high levels of gender-based violence across the country and inequality within the health system.

### Sample Activities

* Create a mechanism for long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between the United Kingdom and Mexico by developing frameworks for knowledge exchange and relationships between a range of institutions.
* Support the Mexican government to review and improve policy to address obesity and diabetes and mechanisms for measuring progress and challenges. This work will complement the government’s significant efforts to reduce health inequalities.
* Support the strengthening of inclusive leadership and learning among health professionals in the Mexican health system.
* Mainstream gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) at all levels of the programme, ensuring the approach is embedded within core programme activities and within the management structures and processes. The work will be based on a nuanced understanding of the cultural, political, and economic context that drives current behaviour.
* Conduct innovative research to understand some of the underlying social drivers of obesity in Mexico and support partnerships with the United Kingdom that will enable high-quality learning for both the United Kingdom and the Mexican public health approach. For example, research might explore how stress and violence links with obesity, inactivity, depression, and poor eating habits, and develop integrated approaches to tackle violence and obesity.
