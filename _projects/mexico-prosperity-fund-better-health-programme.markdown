We are delighted to announce that the FCO has awarded DAI the Mexico component of the Better Health Programme. This programme is financed by the U.K. Cross-Government Prosperity Fund. 

The Mexico Better Health Programme, financed by the U.K. Cross-Government Prosperity Fund, addresess the growing threat of non-communicable diseases — especially obesity and diabetes — with a focus on realizing the economic and social benefits associated with improved health. DAI will foster long-term links between Mexican institutions and the British National Health Service, other U.K. institutions, and networks of researchers and service providers. 

The two-year programme is designed to generate a fruitful exchange of evidence, expertise, and trade. Specifically, DAI will:

Create a mechanism for long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between the United Kingdom and Mexico by developing frameworks for knowledge exchange.
Provide a focal point through which to access high-quality, U.K.-based technical assistance.
Support the Mexican government particularly on obesity and diabetes, and complement the government’s strengths to help it reduce health inequalities.

Our partners include BMJ, the General Medical Council Service International, 2CV, The Institute for Development Studies, and Southampton University Hospital.

Team Leader Eduardo Gonzalez-Pier has held senior positions in Mexico’s health and social security sectors, both in the private sector and in public service. Most recently, he served as Deputy Minister of Health. Previously, he was Executive Chairman of Funsalud, a leading health policy think tank. Dr. Gonzalez-Pier has extensive networks in the new Mexican administration and is a respected thought-leader in health system development.

Technical Director Georgia Taylor has more than 20 years of experience in gender, women’s economic empowerment, private sector development, and sexual and reproductive health. A fluent Spanish speaker, she has extensive experience within DFID, including as Head of the DFID Central America office and leader of the Reproductive and Child Health team in the policy division. 

She will be supported by James McIntyre Brown, who spearheaded the proposal development and previously worked in health systems strengthening in Mexico.

Programme Director Archie Lightfoot has a long record of working with the FCO and is currently supporting DAI’s other two FCO-funded Mexico programmes, Financial Services and Energy. 

This proposal is another example of strong collaboration between the Global Health and Europe business units. It is an important win that builds on DAI’s record as a world leader in health systems strengthening and institutional capacity building. It also affirms DAI’s substantial body of work in international relations, trade, and economic growth for the FCO, and our position as a key supplier under the Prosperity Framework. Congratulations to everyone involved in the winning proposal.
