The Kosovo Strengthening Public Procurement (KSPP) project, part of the FCDO’s Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, works to strengthen the public procurement system in Kosovo to reduce incidents of malfeasance and corruption. It improves practices implemented by contracting authorities, as well as working with the Procurement Review Body (PRB)—a decision-making panel—to ensure professional and fair adjudication of procurement disputes.

### Sample Activities
 
* Ensure that the PRB is well-governed and accountable, maximising the potential of each employee.
* Digitalise the case management system to ensure a more impartial, transparent, and accountable review process, improving the quality of decisions and reducing the risk of corruption.
* Help ensure that PRB decisions are sound, clearly reasoned, and consistent with previously adjudicated cases.
* Strengthen the procurement systems of three targeted contracting authorities to ensure a level playing field and prevent irregularities and corruption.
