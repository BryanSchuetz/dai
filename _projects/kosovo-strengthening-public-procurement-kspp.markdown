While Kosovo has been making positive progress towards reform and the requirements set out in the European Union-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement, corruption and ineffective public procurement remain a critical challenge.

The Kosovo Strengthening Public Procurement (KSPP) project, funded by the British Embassy, Pristina, works to strengthen the public procurement system in Kosovo to reduce incidents of malfeasance and corruption. It improves practices implemented by contracting authorities, as well as working with the Procurement Review Body (PRB)—a decision-making panel—to ensure professional and fair adjudication of procurement disputes.

### Sample Activities
 
* Ensure that the PRB is well-governed and accountable, maximising the potential of each employee.
* Digitalise the case management system to ensure a more impartial, transparent, and accountable review process, improving the quality of decisions and reducing the risk of corruption.
* Help ensure that PRB decisions are based on the law, clearly reasoned, and consistent with previously adjudicated cases.
* Strengthen the procurement systems of three targeted contracting authorities to ensure a level playing field and prevent irregularities and corruption.

### Select Results

* The Case Management System, a module of the Kosovo e-procurement portal, has gone live and is now being used for all complaints against tender dossiers and contract award decisions and is considered to be the most advanced such system in Europe.
