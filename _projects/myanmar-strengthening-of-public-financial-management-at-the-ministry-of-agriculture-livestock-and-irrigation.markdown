Despite the ability of the agricultural system in Myanmar to produce enough food for the whole population, distribution remains highly unequal and depends on the ability of rural households to either produce their own food or earn enough income to purchase food. Efforts to address the inherent weaknesses of the agricultural system in Myanmar hinder on challenges with proper agricultural planning and spending. At the government level, the country has embraced nutrition as a policy priority. In 2018, the Government of the Union of Myanmar developed a Multi-Sectoral National Action Plan for Nutrition to address malnutrition in Myanmar as a multi-sectoral issue.

In July 2019, the European Commission adopted a programme called Enhancing Rural Nutrition in Myanmar: support to the National Agriculture Development Strategy and its contribution to the Multi-Sectoral National Plan of Action for Nutrition. The programme focuses on supporting the implementation of the Agriculture Development Strategy in the policy areas that have a more direct contribution to the reduction of malnutrition, diversifying food production, and improving food safety.

The project intervention seeks to address these challenges through a suite of PFM measures, including the establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation architecture that supports nutrition-sensitive systems, with a focus on women and strengthening the institutional capacity of MoALI to tackle malnutrition.
