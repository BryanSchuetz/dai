The Zinc and Low-osmolarity Oral Rehydration Salts and Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation programme (ZIFAS) developed innovative strategies to improve upon the existing low coverage of low osmolarity Oral Rehydration Salts (L-ORS), zinc, and iron and folic acid supplements in four states in northern Nigeria.

ZIFAS aimed to increase the coverage and quality of antenatal care using low dose IFAS to reduce pregnancy related illnesses and deaths resulting from anaemia in pregnancy. Using a health system strengthening approach, ZIFAS sought to ensure long-term sustainable supply of ZIFAS in the public health system. This includes improving systems for forecasting and procurement as well as supply chain management, capacity building for health managers and service providers, and strengthening government systems for monitoring and evaluation.

Final achievements included:

• Increased coverage and utilisation of antenatal iron and IFAS
• Improved health workers’ awareness of zinc/lo-ORS in diarrhea management
• Zero stock-outs in IFAS commodities at health facilities
• Development of costed integrated annual health plans and medium term procurement plans that included ZIFAS commodities and health service interventions.

This two year project was funded by Micronutrient Initiative. HPI was the lead agency in the consortium managing the programme and subcontracts NPHD, a Nigerian consultancy organisation to undertake technical work for the contract.
