The Innovative Private Sector Development Project (IPSDP) develops entrepreneurship and expands economic opportunity in the Palestinian Territories. IPSDP falls under the World Bank’s overarching objective to alleviate market failures related to gaps and binding constraints in Palestine’s digital entrepreneurship ecosystem—including those related to human capital, financing, product markets, enabling policies, institutional support, and connectivity.
 
Working closely with the Ministry of National Economy, DAI is providing core project management services and technical expertise to: i) link into advanced entrepreneurship ecosystems, focusing on proximate Arab communities; ii) develop a dynamic startup finance ecosystem, with a focus on organized angel investing; iii) develop an outsourcing hub in Gaza; iv) implement an upgraded company registry in the Ministry of National Economy; and v) develop a regulatory framework for home-based businesses that will remove barriers to entry for such enterprises. We will also work with Gaza Gateway to develop an IT services hub able to provide industry-ready IT professionals to the Palestinian market.
