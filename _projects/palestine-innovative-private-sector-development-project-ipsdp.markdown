The Innovative Private Sector Development Project (IPSDP), a pioneering project to develop entrepreneurship and expand economic opportunity in the Palestinian Territories. IPSDP falls under the World Bank’s overarching objective to alleviate market failures related to gaps and binding constraints in Palestine’s digital entrepreneurship ecosystem—including those related to human capital, financing, product markets, enabling policies, institutional support, and connectivity.
 
Working closely with the Ministry of National Economy, DAI will provide core project management services and technical expertise to: i) link into advanced entrepreneurship ecosystems, focusing on proximate Arab communities; ii) develop a dynamic start-up finance ecosystem, with a focus on organized angel investing; iii) develop an outsourcing hub in Gaza; iv) implement an upgraded company registry in the MoNE; and v) develop a regulatory framework for home-based businesses that will remove barriers to entry for such enterprises. We will also work with Gaza Gateway to develop an IT services hub able to provide industry-ready IT professionals to the Palestinian market.
 
Team Leader Rasem Suwan will lead a team including subcontractors Avasant, UK MENA Hub, and Tech Nation.
 
We are looking forward to exploring exciting territory in entrepreneurship financing, tech services development, and impact investment, while adding to DAI’s growing portfolio of World Bank work. Significantly, IPSDP will engage DAI with the Bank’s top leadership in the entrepreneurship and enterprise finance space. Many congratulations to everyone involved in securing this important new project.
