This project works to increase the value of traded timber products, strengthen forest law enforcement and governance, and share forest benefits more equitably through implementation of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT-VPA) between Liberia and the EU. 

The forest sector plays a key role in Liberia’s sustainable socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and economic growth. FLEGT-VPA aims to reduce risk of civil conflict through improvements in forest governance and sustainable forest management.

### Sample Activities
