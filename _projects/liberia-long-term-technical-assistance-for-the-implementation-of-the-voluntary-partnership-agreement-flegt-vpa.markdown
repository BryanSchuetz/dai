This three-year project intends to increase the value of traded timber products, strengthen forest law enforcement and governance, and share forest benefits more equitably through implementation of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT-VPA) between Liberia and the EU. 

The forest sector plays a key role in Liberia’s sustainable socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and economic growth. FLEGT-VPA aims to reduce risk of civil conflict through improvements in forest governance and sustainable forest management.

### Sample Activities

* Build on [earlier results](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-support-unit-liberia-flegt-voluntary-partnership-agreement-vpa) that established systems, institutions, and capacity for the VPA, and further transfer the responsibility for VPA from donors to the Government of Liberia.

* Support Liberia’s Forestry Development Authority in coordination and cooperation between the various support projects, stakeholders, and funders, notably the U.K. Department for International Development.

* Support use and development of the Forward Planner, which details the actions required to raise capacity and achieve compliance with the 11 principles in the VPA.
