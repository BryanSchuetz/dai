DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) conducted a study to determine the economic value added by local content in Trinidad and Tobago’s energy sector. The study evaluated current local content value as well as projections of future value.

The SBG team collected data from operators in the natural gas and petrochemical industries, as well as from energy sector suppliers in Trinidad across 38 supply chain categories. This data was used to quantify the 2016 value of employment and training of nationals, employment of non-nationals, and the procurement of local goods and services. To assess gaps, the team projected the likely value of local employment, training, and procurement based on forecasted energy sector demand for the next 10 years in Trinidad.

Opportunities for growth of local content were identified in professional and energy specific services. SBG provided recommendations for closing the gap between the current value of local content and the potential value that could be contributed.
