SPARC is building the capacity of Nigeria's state governments to support responsive planning and policy formulation, enhanced public financial management and human resources systems, and performance-focused public service. The programme was initially active in the states of Lagos, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, and Jigawa, with five more states added in 2012. Because SPARC works with only a selection of Nigeria's 36 states, federal institutions are being assisted in their capacity to support the reform process across the federation. State-to-state learning and knowledge exchange has also been encouraged.

[SPARC][1] generates success by being embedded and responsive through political and programming cycles, and through technical and political engagement approaches that are politically savvy and locally led.

###  Sample Activities

* Develop best-fit, state-specific public service reform plans with flexible approaches for 10 states and support implementation.
* Manage state self-assessments that lead to locally owned planning.
* Improve government monitoring and evaluation systems.
* Strengthen public financial management systems to reduce waste and improve budget realism, including working with key state ministries to support introduction of tools such as the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, which build stronger linkages between policies and budgets.
* Improve domestic revenue strategies and implementation plans.
* Support knowledge management initiatives within the work streams of lead states, enabling wider and rapid replication and adoption in non-lead states and at the federal level.

###  Select Results

* Supported eight State Development Plans with better linking to budgets.
* Assisted states to produce and roll out 38 medium-term strategies in sectors such as education, health, and agriculture. Supported 65 corporate plans leading to reorganisation of key ministries.
* Closed more than 500 dormant accounts, resulting in savings in Nigeria of N12 billion and in Enugu of N521 million.
* Supported Human Resources Management Information Systems that resulted in the elimination of more than 5,000 ghost workers across lead states.
* Deployed strategies for Domestic Revenue Mobilization (DMR) in nine states, resulting, for example, in increased DMR of N400 million in Nigeria in the first six months of implementation and N13 billion in Kaduna state in 2014.
* Increased spending on education and health—for each £1 spent by SPARC from 2010–2013, target state governments spent an additional £8 on education and health.
* Helped enroll nearly 2.1 million additional children (53 percent girls) in primary and junior secondary schools and ensured that an additional estimated 300,000 children (49 percent girls) received basic vaccinations.
* Strengthened budget preparation processes; Nigeria's budget variance for expenditures decreased from 50 percent in 2011 to 15 percent in 2013.
