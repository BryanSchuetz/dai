Once called the Pearl of the Antilles because of its natural beauty, rich resources, and enviable agricultural production, following decades of recurrent shocks and stresses, Haiti now struggles to adequately feed its population. Almost 60 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line, with 25 percent in extreme poverty. 

The Feed the Future Haiti Resilience and Agriculture Sector Advancement (HRASA) Activity capitalizes on existing opportunities and catalyzes others to improve the competitiveness, inclusion, and resilience of agricultural market systems—ensuring that benefits from strengthened market systems accrue to the most vulnerable and ultimately advance Haiti’s food security and Journey to Self-Reliance.  
 
HRASA improves the efficiency and effectiveness of existing market system actors; stimulates and expands private sector engagement and investment in agricultural market systems; and strengthens the capacity of subsistence farming households to participate in opportunities.
