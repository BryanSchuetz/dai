The Haiti Resilience and Agriculture Sector Advancement (HRASA) Activity builds on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s decades of investment in the Haitian agricultural sector, catalyzing the resourcefulness and innovation of Haitian market system actors to increase individual, household, and community resilience through strengthened, well-functioning, and inclusive market systems.
 
HRASA focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing market system actors; stimulates and expands private sector engagement and investment in agricultural market systems; and strengthens the capacity of subsistence farming households to participate in market system opportunities.
