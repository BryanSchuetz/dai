Once called the Pearl of the Antilles because of its natural beauty, rich resources, and enviable agricultural production, following decades of recurrent shocks and stresses, Haiti now struggles to adequately feed its population. Almost 60 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line, with 25 percent in extreme poverty. But, these dismal statistics do not tell the full story. Smallholder farmers and households continue to cope using traditional strategies, such as diversified production via Jadins Kreyol; Haitian firms, like Novella, RB Ferme La Chapelle, and CLES, and commercially oriented nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) like Organisation pour la Réhabilitation de l’Environnement (ORE) continue to engage smallholder farmers in their supply chains—albeit on a scale too small to radically transform the market systems in the Resilience Focus Zones 
(RFZs). Building on USAID’s decades of investment in Haiti’s agriculture sector, Feed the Future Haiti Resilience and Agriculture Sector Advancement (HRASA), aims to capitalize on existing opportunities and catalyze others to improve the competitiveness, inclusion, and resilience of agricultural market systems—ensuring that benefits from strengthened market systems accrue to the most vulnerable and ultimately advance Haiti’s food security and Journey to Self-Reliance (J2SR).  



The Haiti Resilience and Agriculture Sector Advancement (HRASA) Activity builds on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s decades of investment in the Haitian agricultural sector, catalyzing the resourcefulness and innovation of Haitian market system actors to increase individual, household, and community resilience through strengthened, well-functioning, and inclusive market systems.
 
HRASA improves the efficiency and effectiveness of existing market system actors; stimulates and expands private sector engagement and investment in agricultural market systems; and strengthens the capacity of subsistence farming households to participate in opportunities.
