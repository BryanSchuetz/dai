The constraint on the growth of Afghanistan’s economy that matters most for sustainability is the low productivity of Afghan businesses. Many Afghan firms lack the competitive strength to maintain commercial viability in a distortion-free market, let alone to capture opportunities in export markets. The flagship economic growth project in USAID/Afghanistan’s portfolio, the Afghanistan Competitiveness of Export-Oriented Businesses (ACEBA) project works to increase the competitiveness of export-oriented businesses, promoting sustainable nationwide economic growth.
 
DAI’s market-oriented approach helps Afghan businesses increase the sales-worthiness of their products in international markets. We work with businesses from the inside to help fix their production processes, increase their productivity, and export products that meet international demand at competitive prices. The targeted product value chains are: marble and granite, precious stones, jewelry, carpets, cashmere, and saffron. ACEBA will operate through “regional export accelerators” in the country’s five main urban economic centers.
