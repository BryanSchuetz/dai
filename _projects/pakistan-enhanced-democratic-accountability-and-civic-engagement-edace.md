This project aims to find opportunities to make short-term, high-impact grants to improve rights awareness, citizen engagement, access to justice, and provision of security services to ensure that Pakistani citizen rights and democratic processes are strengthened at provincial and local levels.

The Enhanced Democratic Accountability and Civic Engagement (EDACE) project marks the first time the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office has worked through a professional grants manager. The initial geographic focus will be on Sindh and Punjab.

EDACE also provides an opportunity for DAI to leverage its knowledge from the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) [AAWAZ project][1] which also works to raise citizens' awareness and participation. EDACE works to strengthen constructive citizen-state relations by empowering citizens to know and exercise their rights through democratic processes and fostering state capacity to use democratic processes to respond to citizens' priorities in a timely, transparent, and accountable manner.

###  **Sample Activities**

* Encourage collaborative public-private partnerships to improve education services in marginalized and underserved communities.
* Adapt existing voter education materials for women and minorities.
