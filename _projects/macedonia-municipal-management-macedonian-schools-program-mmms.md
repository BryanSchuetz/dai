###  Sample Activities

* Provide local governments and, to a lesser extent, school directors, school boards, and school inspectors with the training they need to execute their new responsibilities and work together to improve their schools.
* Provide ZELS (the association of units of local self-government in Macedonia) with a combination of expert advice and analytical support so that local and national governments can work together to improve the education system and disseminate best practices across a decentralizing education system.
* Provide direct technical assistance to eight municipalities.
* Develop best practice models of local education management.

###  Select Results

* Created and published a registry of schools for all eight partner municipalities, including assessments of the technical conditions and the relative urgency of needed interventions.
* Published a manual on how to assess schools.
* Trained 44 representatives across all eight municipalities.
