Bosnia and Herzegovina has been implementing public administration reform since 2006. Despite efforts of all levels of government and the results achieved so far, there are tendencies to slow down the reform process. 

This project supported the Public Administration Reform Coordinator's Office at all government levels to efficiently coordinate the process of reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The overall objective was to contribute to public administration reform through building a professional, accountable, transparent, and efficient public administration that delivers high-quality services to citizens and businesses, and effectively transpose and implement the European Union acquis. It worked to improve the sector coordination structure for the efficient implementation of a Strategic Framework and Action Plan. Additionally, the project ensured greater visibility of the reform process to provide citizens support for change, and increase public confidence in the work of public authorities, especially in the institutions that direct and implement the reform process.
