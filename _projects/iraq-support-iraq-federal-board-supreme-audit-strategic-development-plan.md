As Iraq's primary audit institution, the Federal Board of Supreme Audit (FBSA) plays an integral role in ensuring the accountability of public funds, government institutions, and public servants. The board's strategic plan provides a road map for institutional strengthening to help the FBSA fulfill this mandate.

DAI manages this two-year grant, which is being implemented by a team of expert advisors in financial and performance audit, petroleum accounting, fraud detection and prevention, and institutional relationship strengthening.

###  Sample Activities

* Provide in-depth training on performance audit and risk management across three different types of state-owned industries: financial; for-profit; and service.
* Conduct "training of trainers" to develop expertise to plan and execute performance audits for oil and other extractive industries.
* Facilitate study tours and exchanges with supreme audit institutions regionally and globally to countries with an audit bureau and state-owned extractive industries.
* Facilitate town hall discussions between the FBSA and other anti-corruption partners within the Iraqi government.
* Assist the FBSA staff in developing manual that establishes standardized procedures for performance audits.
