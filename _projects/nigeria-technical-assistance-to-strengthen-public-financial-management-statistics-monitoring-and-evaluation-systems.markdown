In Yobe state, Nigeria, high levels of poverty and insufficient access to social services, combined with the effect of Boko Haram crisis on social infrastructure and the livelihoods of citizens, call for a broaden fiscal space and improved delivery of basic services. 

The European Union’s (EU) Technical Assistance to Strengthen Public Financial Management (PFM), Statistics, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems of the state and local governments in Yobe State programme assists the state to build upon the significant progress made so far in fiscal transparency and discipline, by finding ways to broaden the fiscal space in a sustainable manner, while ensuring improved delivery of citizen demanded public goods and services.

The project falls under the EU’s support for early recovery from conflict and resilience building in Yobe State. DAI’s technical assistance team works with key local government officials, civil servants and the civil society to support PFM reform, improve statistics, monitoring, accountability, and reporting, including legislative scrutiny, third-party monitoring, and budget tracking by citizens. The team works to strengthen the state’s aggregate fiscal discipline and ensure more efficient allocation and use of resources.
