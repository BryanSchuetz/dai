The Government of Morocco is investing in the improvement of its social protection system to boost access to health care among the population. DAI is supporting these European Union (EU)-funded efforts through the Technical Assistance to Support Social Protection Reform programme, which works to: coordinate and monitor social protection reforms, based on the logical framework of a result-oriented budget programming; strengthen capacity in social assistance, social insurance, social protection, and health; produce studies to improve the monitoring and evaluation of the reforms; and implement communication and visibility activities.

The project is being implemented in consortium with IBF and Vayans Consulting, two consulting firms based in Belgium and Morocco, respectively.
