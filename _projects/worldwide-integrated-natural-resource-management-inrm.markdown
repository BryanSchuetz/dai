Coordinating and integrating biodiversity conservation with other development efforts, where appropriate, can provide a powerful opportunity to address the multifaceted challenges people face to add value and produce longer-lasting development outcomes. 

With the launch of the [Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework](Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s commitment to integrating natural resource management (NRM), biodiversity conservation, and land and resource governance as foundational elements of the Journey to Self-Reliance is clear.
