Coordinating and integrating biodiversity conservation with other development efforts, where appropriate, can provide a powerful opportunity to address the multifaceted challenges people face to add value and produce longer-lasting development outcomes. 

With the launch of the [Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework](Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s commitment to integrating natural resource management (NRM), biodiversity conservation, and land and resource governance as foundational elements of the Journey to Self-Reliance is clear. Through the Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM) Activity, DAI and its partners [provide](https://www.land-links.org/2020/10/announcing-new-mission-support-activity-for-integrated-environmental-programming/) technical assistance, facilitation, adaptive management, and innovative tools and approaches to assist USAID to drive the uptake and operationalization of the ENRM Framework in five areas:
 
* Assisting missions with the analysis and development of an evidence base to support integrated ENRM programming;
* Supporting and facilitating the design and adaptive management of ENRM programming;
* Testing innovative approaches for integrated ENRM programming;
* Supporting monitoring, evaluation, and learning for integrated programming; and
* Supporting communications and knowledge management initiatives for integrated programming.
 
Partner subcontractors include Social Impact, New America, The Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History, the University of Rhode Island Coastal Resource Centre, Resource Equity, Conservation Strategy Fund, and Stantec.

* Provide Missions with direct and indirect support in integrated program design, the adaptive management of those programs, and the optimization of cross-sectoral programming to meet the mandates of the Journey to Self-Reliance, the New Partnerships Initiative, and the Private Sector Engagement Policy. 
* Help USAID identify new ideas and opportunities to pilot approaches in ways that allow for continuous learning and build the capacity of USAID to test innovation. 
* Develop an ENRM Advisors Program to drive ownership and enthusiasm of the Framework across USAID missions.
