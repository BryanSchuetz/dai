For more than a decade, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported Tajikistan’s agriculture-led economic growth and improved nutrition outcomes in Khatlon. Now the Feed the Future Tajikistan Agriculture and Land Governance (ALG) Activity moves beyond these previous investments to catalyze growth by enabling the local private sector to develop and expand market opportunities and work with government and civil society to drive systemic reforms in the enabling environment for agriculture that allow smallholders and private sector firms to invest and upgrade land through improved registration and administration. Of equal importance, ALG will ensure that women, youth, and vulnerable groups in remote areas in Khatlon are not left behind in the climb, integrating them into market-led opportunities in processing, value addition, and livelihood diversification while deepening their resilience through nutrition-sensitive crop adoption and behavior change. Combined, these efforts will enable Tajikistan to strengthen its journey to self-reliance and reduce its overreliance on remittances from neighboring Russia. 

The Feed the Future Tajikistan Agriculture and Land Governance (ALG) Activity assists the Government of Tajikistan to sustainably reduce hunger, undernutrition, and poverty among smallholder farmers by developing more productive and efficient agriculture systems, building the resilience of smallholders, and improving the enabling environment to facilitate sustainable and long-term, ag-led growth. It supports the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Global Food Security Strategy’s top-line goals of accelerated agriculture-led growth, better nutritional outcomes, improved food security, land tenure security, greater resilience, and better water security.
