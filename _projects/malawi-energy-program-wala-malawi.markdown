In Malawi, low electricity generation capacity and low access to modern energy have combined effect of limiting economic development at national and household levels in both urban and rural communities. The electricity supply system is characterized by over reliance on one source of energy (hydro) with most of the electricity generating stations located on one river, aging infrastructure, weak fault levels and thermal limits and persistent power outages. 

Diversification of the energy mix in Malawi is one of the key pillars of its National Energy Policy wherein electricity generation from renewable sources is envisaged as the mainstay to increase electricity generation capacity and electricity access from 18% (2018) to 30% of the population by 2030. 

Against this backdrop, this project supports the industrialization and diversification of the Malawian electricity sector by implementing the necessary reforms and promoting private sector investments. The contract is part of a wider Program, Malawi Energy Program (Wala Malawi), which is a central component of the Team Europe Initiative (TEI) “Green Growth for Malawi” meant to tackle major challenges that are hampering the resilient transformation of the economy and energy systems in Malawi. 

## Sample Activities

* Ensure effective and efficient policy, and legal and institutional frameworks to improve access to energy as well as strengthen coordination capacities of energy agencies.
* Enhance governance and strategic planning of investments in the national grid with secured financing of priority projects.
* Increase diversification and productive use of renewable energy with private sector participation.
* Ensure the participation of women and people with disabilities in the green and digital economies.
