Development programmes targeting nutrition have been effective in gradually reducing the rate of stunting in Malawi in past years. With one of the highest population growth rates in Africa, the country has, however, not succeeded to reduce the absolute number of stunted children. 

The Technical Assistance to AFIKEPO Nutrition Programme was designed to achieve the results of the European Union’s [AFIKEPO Nutrition Programme](https://www.naosupportmw.org/programmes/nutrition-and-food-security/afikepo), aimed to enhance nutrition security in Malawi. The objective of the programme is to increase and diversify dietary intake of safe and nutritious foods to achieve optimal nutrition for women of childbearing age, adolescent girls, infants, and young children in 10 targeted districts. Moreover, the programme aims to increase the use of enhanced nutrition knowledge, awareness, and hygiene practices, to strengthen multi-sectoral governance of nutrition and monitoring as well as informing national policies.

Our team supports the relevant line ministries, training institutions, and the targeted districts to appraise, plan, and implement activities in a qualitative manner while maintaining a focus on good governance and support coordination and communication and operational research.
