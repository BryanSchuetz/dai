Turkmenistan’s growth and economic development has been hampered by a shortage of well-educated and skilled officials to run the state bodies and to elaborate and implement new policies. To develop the necessary skills within Turkmenistan’s civil service to support civil servants crucial to delivering the governmental reforms underway throughout the country, the European Union-funded the Support to the Public Administration Capacity Building programme. DAI’s team supports the modernisation of the Turkmen Public Administration in line with European standards. 

One of the key policies our team contributes to is the delivery of the main national framework and the public administration reform agenda outlined in the National Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan for 2011–2030. This policy outlines a path forward for Turkmenistan including diversification of the economy, increased competition, and further market and institutional reform. 

In addition to working with the Academy of Civil Servants, our team also engages the Institute for State and Law, the Institute of Democracy and Human Rights, Turkmen State University, the International University of Humanities, and the Institute of International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.
