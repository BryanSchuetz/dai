Turkmenistan’s growth and economic development has been hampered by a shortage of well-educated and skilled officials to run the state bodies and to elaborate and implement new policies. To develop the necessary skills within Turkmenistan’s civil service to support civil servants crucial to delivering the reforms underway throughout the country, the European Union is funding the Support to the Public Administration Capacity Building programme. DAI’s Human Dynamics team supports the modernisation of the Turkmen Public Administration in line with European standards. 

One of the key policies which our team will contribute to the delivery of is the main national framework and the public administration reform agenda outlined in the National Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan for 2011–2030. This policy outlines a path forward for Turkmenistan including diversification of the economy, increased competition, and further market and institutional reform. 

In addition to working with the Academy of Civil Servants, our team also engages the Institute for State and Law, the Institute of Democracy and Human Rights, Turkmen State University, and the Institute of International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.

•	-Major part of project implementation efforts are focused on the development of the Master of Public Administration Programme (MPA) for the Academy of Civil Service under the President of Turkmenistan  
•	The Working Group (WG) on development of the MPA was established and at least one professor/lecturer from the AoCS and/or other Turkmen educational institution was nominated to be responsible for the development of the curriculum and training materials for each of the modules of the MPA. Working Group  meetings were initiated in October 2018, and since then,  members meet on regular basis (each month) to discuss the progress achieved in development of the MPA programme in general, as well as specific issues of structure, requirements, substance of specific modules of the programme. 
•	To ensure a constant dialogue and and follow-up on MPA development, the Project Team invites for each working group meeting a representative of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan. This allows feedback on the MPA programme from the Ministry of Education of Turkmenistan, which will be then responsible for official endorsement of the MPA programme at the later stages. 

•	A series of workshops and consultations for professors and lecturers from AoCS and other Turkmen educational institutions were organised to present the contents and the provisional structure of the MPA. Two rounds of training of trainers´ workshops with a total number of 36 participants were delivered. Four workshops on the Master´s programme in public administration were conducted with a total number of 177 participants.
