A shortage of well-educated and skilled officials to run state agencies and create new policies has hampered Turkmenistan’s growth and economic development. To help develop these skills within Turkmenistan’s civil service, the European Union is funding the Support to the Public Administration Capacity Building program. DAI’s team supports the modernization of the Turkmen Public Administration in line with European standards. 

A key focus of this effort is to deliver the  national framework and public administration reform agenda outlined in the National Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Turkmenistan for 2011–2030. This policy sets a path for Turkmenistan to diversify its economy, increase competition, and further market and institutional reforms. 

In addition to working with the Academy of Civil Servants, DAI also engages with the Institute for State and Law, the Institute of Democracy and Human Rights, Turkmen State University, the International University of Humanities, and the Institute of International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan.
