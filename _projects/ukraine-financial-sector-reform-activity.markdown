Building on three decades of support to Ukraine’s financial sector, including the recently completed  [Financial Sector Transformation Activity (FST)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-transforming-financial-sector-fst)—the Financial Sector Reform (FSR) Activity supports Ukraine’s economic development and growth. 

FSR builds the capacity of financial sector regulators and the many actors that make up Ukraine’s nascent financial ecosystem—including the private sector and civil society—to develop new financial architecture and instruments that support Ukrainian businesses and consumers. It leverages FST’s critical legal and regulatory reforms in the non-bank sector, including passage of the Split Law, the Regulated Markets Law, and anticorruption legislation. It will promote non-bank small business and consumer finance, and advocate for consumer protection laws and mechanisms that build public trust in the system.
 
Given the ongoing Russian invasion, FSR will work with donors and other development finance institutions to coordinate support to the financial sector and financial sector contribution to the rebuilding of Ukraine.



Although still underdeveloped, Ukraine stands poised to continue its transition to a system in which all businesses have access to finance, where bank and non-bank financial institutions operate as efficient and transparent intermediaries, once the conflict subsides.

With additional support and development, its financial system can provide the integrity, stability, and transparency to enable price discovery, raise capital, increase savings and investment, and provide risk management for businesses to fully participate.It is against this backdrop that USAID has designed the Financial Sector Reform Activity(FSR). Building on three decades of support to Ukraine’s financial sector, including the current DAI-managed Financial Sector Transformation Activity (FST), USAID has designed FSR to support Ukraine’s economic development and growth. FSR will build the capacity of financial sector regulators and the many actors that make up its nascent financial ecosystem—including the private sector and civil society—to develop new financial architecture and instruments to support Ukrainian businesses and consumers. It will leverage FST’s critical legal and regulatory reforms in the non-bank sector, including passage of the Split Law, the Regulated Markets Law, and anticorruption legislation. It will promote non-bank SME and consumer finance, and advocate for consumer protection laws and mechanisms that build public trust in the system. Importantly, FSR will complete FST’s foundational efforts to create a world-class, multi-asset capital and commodity market and trading hub, NEXT-UA, in partnership with the U.S.and Ukrainian Governments.To implement FSR, DAI—with more than 30years of experience implementing financial sector reform projects globally for USAID and other donors—has assembled a top-notch consortium that balances both local and international expertise. For FSR, we have partnered with the global professional services firm EY,which brings strong Ukrainian and international expertise in legal, regulatory, tax,and capital market reform;and OSC, a U.S.small business specializingin communications to build the capacity of government, civil society,and media in communications and messaging around reform (see box). We will take a financial systems change approach that moves Ukraine along a market-driven pathway to create a modern, transparent, resilient,and competitive financial sector. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of actors in making transitions toward that tipping point. It acknowledges an uneven reform pathway that will require FSR to meet stakeholders “where they are,” build confidence to grow,and adapt to the state of the political economy. Given our team’s presence in Ukraine, we have the unique ability to hit the ground running, quickly mobilizing our highly experienced staff and providing a seamless transition from FST to FSR. We will leverage our deep relationships with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the National Securitiesand Stock Market Commission (NSSMC);financial institutions and market infrastructure actors;civil society;media;and donors, especially international financial institutions (IFIs), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Union (EU). We will have a finger on the pulse of the changing market landscape to adapt FSR to maximize results and sustainability.DAI believes deeply that local actors,including the private sector,should drive a country’s development. To build the capacity of business advocates, associations, consumer watchdogs,and academia to educate and protect Ukrainian consumers and businesses from misinformation over the long term, we will use our Grants Under Contract (GUC) facility to fund new oversight mechanisms, improved journalism and tools that enable everyday Ukrainians to understand and trust the system. Given the level of specialization required to implement FSR, DAI will also use a Flexible Activity Fund to source highly technical expertise from local partners and underutilized, international niche finance firms, including U.S.small businesses. Through our experience with FST and the global INVEST mechanism, we have innovated our procurement systems to rapidly and compliantly procure specialized financial talent thatwill allow DAI and USAID to achieve FSR’s objective of a well-functioning, competitive financial market aligned to EU and international standards that its businessesand citizens trust.
