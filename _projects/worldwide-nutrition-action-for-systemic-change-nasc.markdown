Nutrition Action for Systemic Change (NASC) is contracted through the Expert Advisory Call Down Service 2 (EACDS2) Lot 4: Climate, Nature and Global Health funded by UKaid. EACDS technical advisory services provide rapid, quality-assured, short-term technical expertise to support the development of U.K. aid programs. 

NASC provides specific technical expertise on nutrition and food systems, building on previous achievements in nutrition and food systems funded by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). NASC supports FCDO to uphold its commitments made at the 2021 Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit to integrate nutrition across its aid portfolio in different sectors, spend at least £1.5 billion up to 2030 on programs that help improve nutrition, and adopt and embed the Nutrition Policy Marker (NPM) within FCDO systems. The facility is a one-year initiative following on from the Technical Assistance to Strengthen Capabilities (TASC) Project, which contributed to improved nutrition planning and programming and accelerated action on nutrition as part of the Technical Assistance for Nutrition (TAN) Programme. 

Our consortium partners are  NutritionWorks,  Development Initiatives,  The Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and Options. 

NASC supports FCDO’s objectives to reform food systems to promote healthy and sustainable diets, integrate nutrition into health systems, respond to food and nutrition crises, and establish close links with FCDO’s broader commitment to end preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and children by 2030, including in fragile and conflict-affected settings. 
 
Technical assistance is provided as short- or long-term expertise and targets programs across all stages, from design to implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and learning. NASC’s approach revolves around ensuring good coordination, communication, engagement, capacity building, and production of high-quality deliverables.
