LWP will increase reliable and sustainable access to water for Lebanese citizens, improve water management practices, enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the public water utilities, and respond to water issues arising from the influx of Syrian refugees. We will also promote better water governance as a means to assure the long-term protection of Lebanon's water resources. In implementing the program, we will prioritize sustainability—environmental, financial, and social—and engage with the private sector and municipalities to ensure widespread buy-in for change.

LWP aims to build on the successes of the [Lebanon Waste and Wastewater Sector Support][1] project (2009–2015).
