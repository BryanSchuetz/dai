LWP is increasing reliable and sustainable access to water for Lebanese citizens, improving water management practices, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the public water utilities, and responding to water issues arising from the influx of Syrian refugees. We are promoting better water governance as a means to assure the long-term protection of Lebanon's water resources. In implementing the program, we have prioritized sustainability—environmental, financial, and social—and engagement with the private sector and municipalities to ensure widespread buy-in for change.

LWP is building on the successes of the [Lebanon Waste and Wastewater Sector Support](/our-work/projects/lebanon-water-and-wastewater-sector-support-lwwss) project that from 2009 to 2015.
