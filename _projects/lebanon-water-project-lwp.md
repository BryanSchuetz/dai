The Lebanon Water Project (LWP) is increasing reliable and sustainable access to water for Lebanese citizens, [improving water management practices](https://medium.com/usaid-global-waters/saving-livelihoods-one-drop-at-a-time-269e1f3a9af7), enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the public water utilities, and responding to water issues arising from the influx of Syrian refugees. We are promoting better water governance as a means to assure the long-term protection of Lebanon's water resources. In implementing the program, we have prioritized sustainability—environmental, financial, and social—and engagement with the private sector and municipalities to ensure widespread buy-in for change.

LWP is building on the successes of the [Lebanon Waste and Wastewater Sector Support](/our-work/projects/lebanon-water-and-wastewater-sector-support-lwwss) project that ran from 2009 to 2015.
