Mozambique has one of the best records of sustained economic growth in Africa, averaging a 7 percent increase in GDP per year for the last decade. However, poverty and malnutrition rates remain high while food availability is limited by low yields and inadequate access to markets. To address these issues, the government of Mozambique has launched an ambitious plan to grow its agricultural sector in an inclusive manner to reduce poverty and alleviate hunger throughout the country.

In support of this goal, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has launched the Feed the Future Agricultural Innovations (FTF Inova) project to partner with farmers, businesses, and policymakers to explore ways to improve production and increase sales of key cash crops vital to Mozambique’s economy. In addition to providing technical assistance and training, FTF Inova leverages project funds to strategically buy down risk and co-finance with farmers and agribusiness to promote investments in equipment upgrades, climate-smart agriculture, and [women’s empowerment](https://www.agrilinks.org/post/leveraging-gender-norms-and-private-sector-partnerships-increase-womens-use-agricultural-inputs).

In developing value chains, FTF Inova takes a portfolio approach adapted from the finance industry, relying on diversified assets, [active monitoring](https://www.marketlinks.org/post/prove-and-improve-adapting-monitoring-evaluation-and-learning-mel-better-support-business) of performance, and the flexibility to rebalance investments based on changing market dynamics. Also central to FTF Inova’s work is the co-creation of pilot interventions, which involves partnering with local private-sector firms to develop innovative and inclusive agribusiness models and demonstrating their viability to potential stakeholders.

### Sample Activities

* Conduct comprehensive, gender-responsive value chain analyses for key crops, such as sesame, soybeans, and cowpeas, to better understand market inefficiencies and address root causes of underperformance.
* Promote the adoption of improved seed varieties and fertilizers to increase crop yields through use of demonstration plots, agricultural extension trainings, and [radio and text messaging campaigns](https://medium.com/@FeedtheFuture/radios-help-businesses-reach-smallholder-farmers-ad64dd560625).
* Collaborate with financial institutions and village savings and loan associations to provide credit lines targeted at enabling smallholder farmers to invest in improved seeds, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs.

### Select Results

* Partners and beneficiaries reported $29 million in sales in fiscal year 2019.
* Established 28 new or improved relationships among private firms. For example, community radio stations established new commercial relationships with private firms such as Bayer and Syngenta to replicate radio programs that were piloted with Phoenix seeds in collaboration with the project.
* Enabled 16,867 hectares of land to be under improved technologies and management practices.
* Assisted—through our partners—13,713 people, of which 37 percent are women, with improved management practices and technologies on their farms.
