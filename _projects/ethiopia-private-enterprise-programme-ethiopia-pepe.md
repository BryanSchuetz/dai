Enterprise Partners is the major component of the U.K. Department for International Development's Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia (PEPE). Enterprise Partners facilitates agro-industrial growth and enables access to finance. Our work will result in job and income opportunities and increased stability for poor people, particularly women. The planned impact is to create 45,000 jobs (75 percent for women) and increase incomes for 65,000 poor households.

DAI implements this work with consortium partners First Consult (Ethiopia), Itad (United Kingdom), Enclude (Netherlands), and BCaD. We utilize the [market systems approach](https://www.dai.com/news/new-primer-market-systems-development-available) to achieve the impact. Enterprise Partners identifies key constraints and develops socially and environmentally responsible strategies, working with industry actors to introduce new business models. This is leading to a better business enabling environment and investment generation in Ethiopia.

[Enterprise Partners](https://beamexchange.org/practice/programme-index/117/) works through two major pillars:

* **Agro-Industry:** Strengthening market systems in three priority sectors of the Government of Ethiopia—cotton, textile, and apparel; leather and livestock; and fruits and vegetables.

* **Access to Finance:** Strengthening financial systems for increased financial inclusion of the poor into formal financial systems and enabling investments for small, medium, and large enterprises.

### Sample Activities

* Garments: [Improve labour market systems](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/ethiopia-stands-poised-to-lead-an-african-industrial-revolution/) and cotton production to create a sustainable industry with strong backward linkages. Support the Government of Ethiopia’s flagship [Hawassa Industrial Park](https://www.dai.com/news/development-secretary-priti-patel-stresses-economic-growth-in-visit-to-ethiopia-industrial-park), which will create 60,000 jobs in the apparel sector.

* Leather: Increase finishing capacity of tanneries and produce high-value leather products to increase exports.

* Horticulture: Promote production of high-value crops for export and support the processing industry.

* Financial Inclusion: Promote digital banking so poor people living in rural Ethiopia have increased access to formal financial services such as savings and loans.

* SME Finance: Provide technical assistance and finance (via a World Bank credit line) to banks, microfinance institutions, leasing companies, and the Development Bank of Ethiopia to support small and medium-sized enterprises that are women-owned or contributing to industrial growth.

* Investments: Promote foreign direct investment and private equity capital investment, especially in priority agro-industrial sectors.
