Enterprise Partners is the major component of the U.K. Department for International Development's Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia (PEPE). Enterprise Partners is facilitating agro-industrial growth and enabling access to finance in Ethiopia. Our work will result in job and income opportunities and increased stability for poor people, particularly women. The planned impact is to create 45,000 jobs (75 percent for women) and increase incomes for 65,000 poor households.

DAI is implementing this work with consortium partners First Consult/Ethiopia, Itad/UK, Enclude/NL, and BCaD. Enterprise Partners is utilizing the market systems approach to achieve the impact. Enterprise Partners will identify key constraints and develop socially and environmentally responsible strategies working with industry actors to introduce new business models. This will lead to a better business enabling environment and investment generation in Ethiopia; creating job and income opportunities for poor.
Enterprise Partners has two major pillars to achieve the goal:
•	Agro-Industry: Enterprise Partners is expected to strengthen market systems in three priority sectors of Government of Ethiopia which are: Cotton, Textile and Apparel, Leather and Livestock, Fruits and Vegetables.  
•	Access to Finance: Enterprise Partners is expected to strengthen financial systems in Ethiopia for increased financial inclusion of poor into formal system and to enable investment for SMEs and Large Enterprises.


This program is helping generate access to finance, [good quality jobs](https://www.dai.com/news/development-secretary-priti-patel-stresses-economic-growth-in-visit-to-ethiopia-industrial-park), and increased incomes for Ethiopia's poor. To achieve its overall end, DAI and consortium partners First Consult/Ethiopia, Itad/UK, Enclude/NL, and BCaD focus on three pillars:

* [Women's Entrepreneurship Development Program (WEDP)][1]—enhance the capacity of the Development Bank of Ethiopia to manage a fund of $42 million provided by the World Bank for on-lending through microfinance institutions (MFIs) to small and medium-sized women-owned enterprises in the urban centers of Adama, Bahir Dar, Hawassa, and Mekelle.
* Access to Finance (A2F)—Using a Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P) approach, work with financial institutions at all levels to ensure that poor Ethiopians can obtain finance to launch and grow sustainable businesses.
* Agro-Industrial Development—The WEDP and A2F teams will integrate their work with PEPE's M4P programming to strengthen value chains in livestock and leather, cotton and textiles, and horticulture.

###  Sample Activities

* Capitalize on buyer-driven income/employment growth by targeting specific marketing channels in which unmet demand exists—subsequently facilitating a pro-poor supply response.
* Making "green" business models work for the poor.
* Assist microfinance institutions so they can make more financial products available to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
