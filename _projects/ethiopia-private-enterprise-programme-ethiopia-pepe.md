Enterprise Partners is the major component of the U.K. Department for International Development's Private Enterprise Programme Ethiopia (PEPE). Enterprise Partners is facilitating agro-industrial growth and enabling access to finance in Ethiopia. Our work will result in job and income opportunities and increased stability for poor people, particularly women. The planned impact is to create 45,000 jobs (75 percent for women) and increase incomes for 65,000 poor households.

DAI is implementing this work with consortium partners First Consult/Ethiopia, Itad/UK, Enclude/NL, and BCaD. Enterprise Partners is utilizing the market systems approach to achieve the impact. Enterprise Partners is identifying key constraints and developing socially and environmentally responsible strategies working with industry actors to introduce new business models. This is leading to a better business enabling environment and investment generation in Ethiopia; creating job and income opportunities for poor.

Enterprise Partners has two major pillars to achieve the goal:
* **Agro-Industry:** Strengthening market systems in three priority sectors of the Government of Ethiopia—cotton, textile and apparel; leather and livestock; and fruits and vegetables.  
* **Access to Finance:** Strengthening financial systems in Ethiopia for increased financial inclusion of poor into formal financial systems and enabling investments for small, medium-sized, and large enterprises.

* Leather and Livestock: Increase finishing capacity of tanneries and produce high value leather products to increase export.
* Fruits and Vegetables: Increase national production of fruits and vegetables from highly productive farms using quality inputs (seed, seedlings etc.).
