This program is helping generate access to finance, [good quality jobs](https://www.dai.com/news/development-secretary-priti-patel-stresses-economic-growth-in-visit-to-ethiopia-industrial-park), and increased incomes for Ethiopia's poor. To achieve its overall end, DAI and consortium partners First Consult/Ethiopia, Itad/UK, Enclude/NL, and BCaD focus on three pillars:

* [Women's Entrepreneurship Development Program (WEDP)][1]—enhance the capacity of the Development Bank of Ethiopia to manage a fund of $42 million provided by the World Bank for on-lending through microfinance institutions (MFIs) to small and medium-sized women-owned enterprises in the urban centers of Adama, Bahir Dar, Hawassa, and Mekelle.
* Access to Finance (A2F)—Using a Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P) approach, work with financial institutions at all levels to ensure that poor Ethiopians can obtain finance to launch and grow sustainable businesses.
* Agro-Industrial Development—The WEDP and A2F teams will integrate their work with PEPE's M4P programming to strengthen value chains in livestock and leather, cotton and textiles, and horticulture.

###  Sample Activities

* Capitalize on buyer-driven income/employment growth by targeting specific marketing channels in which unmet demand exists—subsequently facilitating a pro-poor supply response.
* Making "green" business models work for the poor.
* Assist microfinance institutions so they can make more financial products available to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
