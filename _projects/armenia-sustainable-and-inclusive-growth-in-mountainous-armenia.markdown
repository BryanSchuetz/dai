The Sustainable and Inclusive Growth in Mountainous Armenia (SIGMA) project aims to reduce poverty and inequality in the mountainous regions of Armenia by improving sustainable employment. Sigma has two primary outcomes:

* Help farmers, agribusiness and tourism businesses increase their revenues and employ more people.
* Strengthen value chains of select industries to boost sustainable economic growth.

SIGMA takes a market systems development approach to bolster growth—primarily in the agricultural sector—in the poor rural regions of Armenia. Working with local and international experts in agricultural productivity, value chains, political economy analysis, SIGMA will facilitate grant partnerships that help local markets grow. 

The project takes a research-based, strategic approach to identify how market conditions and current geopolitics can enhance economic productivity in targeted areas. DAI will partner with businesses to help strengthen their operations and growth strategies, helping business owners create more jobs and become more profitable.
