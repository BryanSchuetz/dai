The Nigeria State Accountability, Transparency, and Effectiveness (State2State) Activity supports strengthened governance structures in six states in Nigeria to improve their ability to plan and budget, raise revenues, increase civil society participation, and oversee service delivery in the health; education; and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sectors. State2State works primarily at the state level, but also supports federal institutions and local government areas. 
 
We partner with key Nigerian organizations to capture, document, and share best practices in budgeting, planning, revenue mobilization, audit, procurement, internal controls, policy monitoring and evaluation, gender, and conflict mitigation—ensuring with our partner states that this information becomes available to states across Nigeria.
