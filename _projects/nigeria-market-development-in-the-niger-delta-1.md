Despite having the largest economy in Africa, vibrant commercial centres, and a sizable oil and gas industry, half of Nigeria’s population still lives below the poverty line. Nowhere is this contrast in living standards more apparent than in the Niger Delta region, made up of nine oil-producing southern states. Much of the Delta’s population are farmers in remote villages without access to modern agricultural equipment, supplies, or markets. The result has been a cycle of subsistence farming and poverty, despite economic gains elsewhere in the country.
The Market Development in the Niger Delta Phase I (MADE I) project took a market systems development approach that supported economic growth in the region. MADE I worked with private sector partners in agricultural inputs, palm oil, fisheries, poultry, and cassava value chains to improve access to inputs and markets for small farmers. As a result, more than 150,000 people raised their incomes, half of whom were women.
