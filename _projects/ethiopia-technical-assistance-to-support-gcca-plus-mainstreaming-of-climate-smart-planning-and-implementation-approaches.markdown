The Government of Ethiopia has placed addressing the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation high on its development agenda, endorsing relevant policies, strategies, and guidelines with the potential to bring about integrated rural development. 

The project, “Technical Assistance to support GCCA+ Mainstreaming of Climate-Smart Planning and Implementation Approaches into the Productive Safety Net Program IV (PSNP4) in Ethiopia,” works to enhance the capacities of the Public Works Coordination Unit (PWCU) and of the Food Security Coordination Directorate (FSCD) in activities planning and design. 

The project team uses modern instruments such as GIS and remote sensing for monitoring and evaluation and is developing a National Protocol of Climate Smart Procedures to mainstream climate change. The project will provide technical assistance to enable the Ministry of Agriculture to:
•	mainstreaming climate smart initiative in the watershed and rangeland activities planning and implementation in the Productive Safety Net Program IV at federal and regional levels;
•	enhance institutional and technical capacity in activities planning, management and monitoring of PSNP's public works component improving the coordination with the Sustainable Land Management Program (SLMP) and securing a climate smart approaches at federal and regional levels; and
•	enable the Ministry generate evidences to promote dialogue on climate sensitive development programming and for future climate financing.
The Technical Assistance will be provided at federal level, through four key experts based at the Ministry of Agriculture – Natural Resource Management Directorate, and at regional level, through nine regional coordinators in the regional Public Works Coordination offices covering six regions (Amhara region, Oromia, Harari/Dire Dawa, SNNPR, Afar, Somali, and Tigray Region).
Sample activities:

•	Review of climate-smart social protection programmes and local adaptation planning;
•	Stock take of climate vulnerability and climate smart practices in Ethiopia;
•	Design of a national protocol of climate smart procedures (tools and processes);
•	Roll-out action plan and scaling up strategy;
•	Capacity building and supervision support;
•	Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation, and Monitoring, Report and Verification (MRV) capacity, coordination and contribution to PSNP review systems;
•	Set up of a GIS/MIS for assessing uptake and effectiveness of new climate-smart practices;
•	Supporting linkages with climate and disaster risk reporting and early warning systems;
•	Design and implementation of a knowledge strategy;
•	Mitigation gains and carbon sequestration monitoring;
•	Design and implement a Communications and Visibility strategy;
•	Strategic engagement on sector dialogue and climate finance.
