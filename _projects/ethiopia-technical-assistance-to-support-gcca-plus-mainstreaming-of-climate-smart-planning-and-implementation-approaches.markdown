The Government of Ethiopia has placed addressing the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation high on its development agenda, endorsing relevant policies, strategies, and guidelines with the potential to bring about integrated rural development.

The GCCA+/Mainstreaming of Climate-Smart Planning and Implementation Approaches into the Productive Safety Net Program IV (PSNP4) project in Ethiopia is enhancing the capacities of the Public Works Coordination Unit (PWCU) and of the Food Security Coordination Directorate (FSCD) in activities planning and design.

The project team uses modern instruments such as GIS and remote sensing for monitoring and evaluation and is developing a national protocol of climate-smart procedures. The project is providing technical assistance to enable the Ministry of Agriculture to:

* Mainstream climate-smart initiatives in the watershed and rangeland activities planning, and implement the Productive Safety Net Program IV.
* Enhance institutional and technical capacity in planning, implementation, and monitoring for climate smart outcomes in PSNP4’s public works and livelihoods components.
* Generate evidence to promote dialogue on climate-sensitive development programming and for future climate financing.

## Sample Activities

* Map climate hazard and vulnerability together with current use of  climate-smart practices and technologies, to use in planning.
* Design and roll out a national roadmap for mainstreaming of climate smart procedures, tools, and processes.
* Strengthen monitoring and evaluation of adaptation, resilience and carbon sequestration.
* Support linkages of PSNP planning processes with climate and disaster risk reduction and early warning systems.
