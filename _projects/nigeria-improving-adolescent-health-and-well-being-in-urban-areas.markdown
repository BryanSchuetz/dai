We are delighted to announce that DAI has won the Youth-Powered Ecosystem to Advance Urban Adolescent Health and Well-Being in Nigeria program. This five-year cooperative agreement will empower young Nigerians to think about their futures differently and access the skills, social capital, and resources needed to realize their aspirations.
 
Specifically, the program will improve the health and well-being of urban, poor adolescents age 15–19 by increasing voluntary family planning uptake, situating family planning within a broader, more holistic context that encompasses: 1) life skills—enhancing youth life skills for healthy living and future planning; 2) leadership—fostering an enabling social and policy environment for adolescent health and development; and 3) livelihoods—increasing youth workforce readiness, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship to address socioeconomic determinants of adolescent health.
In addition to pursuing these three primary objectives, the program will implement three crosscutting objectives: 1) local capacity development, 2) evidence generation and learning, and 3) effective program management.  
Chief of Party Boladale Akin-Kolapo will lead a project team that includes three Nigerian sub-awardees— Yellow Brick Road, the Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative, and the Women Friendly Initiative— and an international organization, Grassroots Soccer. 
This award was procured through the Broad Agency Announcement process and marks DAI’s first win as a prime on a major USAID project in Nigeria in more than 10 years. Thanks and congratulations to the proposal team on an award that reflects exemplary collaboration across One DAI.
