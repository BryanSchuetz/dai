In Nigeria, the growing urban youth population includes an increasingly marginalized segment—adolescents who are out-of-school, unmarried, married, or underprivileged, facing high rates of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies. Unfortunately, they also face more barriers in accessing accurate, reliable health information, as traditional programs have struggled to reach them or meet their needs. 

The U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Youth-Powered Ecosystem to Advance Urban Adolescent Health activity [empowers](https://www.usaid.gov/nigeria/press-releases/usaid-takes-novel-approach-improving-adolescent-health) young people with skills, social capital, and resources needed to realize their full potential. The program improves adolescent health by increasing access to voluntary family planning services and situating family planning within a broader, more holistic context of youth empowerment, coupled with a deeper understanding of the challenges that adolescents face. 

The program works to improve skills for healthy living and future planning; foster an enabling social and policy environment for adolescent health and development; and increase youth workforce readiness, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship to address socioeconomic determinants of adolescent health.
