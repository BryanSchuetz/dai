The Youth-Powered Ecosystem to Advance Urban Adolescent Health and Well-Being program empowers young Nigerians to think about their futures differently and access the skills, social capital, and resources needed to realize their aspirations. The program will improve the health and well-being of urban, low-income adolescents ages 15 to 19 by increasing voluntary family planning uptake, situating family planning within a broader, more holistic context that encompasses: 1) enhancing youth life skills for healthy living and future planning; 2) fostering an enabling social and policy environment for adolescent health and development; and 3) increasing youth workforce readiness, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship to address socioeconomic determinants of adolescent health.

In addition to pursuing these three primary objectives, the program will implement local capacity development, evidence generation and learning, and effective program management.  

Our Nigerian partner firms are Yellow Brick Road, the Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative, and the Women Friendly Initiative, and an international organization, Grassroots Soccer. 

### Sample Activities

* Establish youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health and rights services, other social support, and job training and opportunities. We will integrate youth-led, human-centered design to ensure that project interventions meet adolescents’ needs. 
* Implement social and behavior change activities combined with youth engagement with local policy makers and private sector partners.
