The Youth-Powered Ecosystem to Advance Urban Adolescent Health and Well-Being activity empowers young Nigerians to think about their futures differently and access the skills, social capital, and resources needed to realize their aspirations. The program works to improve the health and well-being of urban, low-income adolescents, ages 15 to 19, by increasing voluntary family planning uptake, situating family planning within a broader, more holistic context that encompasses: 1) enhancing youth life skills for healthy living and future planning; 2) fostering an enabling social and policy environment for adolescent health and development; and 3) increasing youth workforce readiness, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship to address socioeconomic determinants of adolescent health.  

Our Nigerian partner firms are Yellow Brick Road, the Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative, and the Women Friendly Initiative, and an international organization, Grassroots Soccer.
