The Government of Georgia has implemented a number of reforms to strengthen the Rule of Law with emphasis on prevention and fight against organized crime. Since 2013, the Interagency Coordinating Council on Fight against Organized Crime has been mandated with the update, coordination, and implementation of the new National Strategy of 2017-2020 for Combatting Organized Crime and its Action Plan.

Our project supports the implementation of the strategy and its plan to build the capacity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and its relevant departments involved in the fight against organized crime, as well as law enforcement and State Security Services. 

The project also works towards enhancing cooperation with transborder and international law enforcement agencies. The completion of the main results is linked to the Visa Liberalization Action Plan that has set several obligations and benchmarks for its implementation within the competence of the Ministry of Interior in Georgia.
