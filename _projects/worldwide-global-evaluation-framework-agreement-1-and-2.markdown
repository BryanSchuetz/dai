This framework builds on its predecessor GEFA, through which HPI supported the implementation of the **[Evaluation of Maternal Newborn and Child Health Programme in Zimbabwe](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/evaluation-of-maternal-newborn-and-child-health-zimbabwe/)** and the **[Evaluation of the Health Partnership Scheme](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/evaluation-of-the-health-partnership-scheme/)**.

GEFA 2 covers a range of geographic locations including fragile and conflicted- affected states.

## GEFA

Health Partners International provided niche technical expertise in health and social development as a prime contractor to UK aid on the Global Evaluation Framework Agreement (GEFA).

Key priorities in relation to this framework were to ensure the provision of efficient and effective consultancy services for the design and implementation of evaluation across UK aid programmes, adhering to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committe (DAC) Quality Standards for Development Evaluation. GEFA is UK aid’s primary route for engaging service providers for a mix of long term and short term evaluation programmes and consultancy opportunities.

Under this Framework Contract, HPI provided technical support in the following thematic areas:

* health

* governance

* capacity building

* social development

* aid instruments

Projects awarded under this Framework include:

* **[Evaluation of Maternal Newborn and Child Health Programme, Zimbabwe](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/evaluation-of-maternal-newborn-and-child-health-zimbabwe/)**

* **[Evaluation of the Health Partnership Scheme](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/evaluation-of-the-health-partnership-scheme/)**
