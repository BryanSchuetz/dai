Health Partners International and WISE Development, both DAI Global Health firms, have been named to the Global Evaluation Framework Agreement 2 (GEFA 2) for Lot 1 covering Impact Evaluation. GEFA 2 ensures the provision of efficient and effective expert services for the design and implementation of evaluations delivered by the U.K. Department for International Development and other government departments.

All consortium partners provide technical assistance to support human development in the following areas: health, water supply, sanitation, social protection, and education.

This framework builds on its predecessor GEFA, through which Health Partners International supported the implementation of the Evaluation of Maternal Newborn and Child Health Programme in Zimbabwe and the Evaluation of the Health Partnership Scheme.

GEFA 2 covers a range of geographic locations including fragile and conflicted-affected states.
