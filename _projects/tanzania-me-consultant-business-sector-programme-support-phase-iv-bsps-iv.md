The fourth phase of the Business Sector Programme Support (BSPS IV) has three components—Agricultural Markets Development, Improved Business Climate, and Access to Finance—and six subcomponents.

While partner organizations are responsible for implementing and managing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for the subcomponents, DAI's consultancy is developing and implementing a coherent M&E system for BSPS IV and its three components—Agricultural Markets Development, Improved Business Climate, and Access to Finance.

###  Sample Activities

* Fine-tune BSPS IV log frame and M&E system to monitor progress.
* Assist Danida programme partners in fine-tuning subcomponent log frames and M&E systems; provide technical support to partner organisations to build their capacity in M&E.
* Conduct baseline studies and assist in developing targets for all indicators.
* Undertake studies as and when required by Danida and its partners.
