Our [ProParque][1] team is helping Honduras develop sound management of its natural resources in a way that complements the country's economic and social development. We are working with the Government of Honduras to strengthen the nation's protected area management system, improve biodiversity and natural resource management, and facilitate [rural enterprise growth][2], climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and clean energy development.

The goal: improve Honduran biodiversity conservation, create local jobs, and strengthen national capacity for mitigating and adapting to global climate change. Honduras and its Bay Islands have rich natural resources—stunning coral reefs, mangroves, rainforests, [cloud forests][3], mountain ranges, and an abundance of endemic plant and [animal species][4]. ProParque works side-by-side with the government, private sector, and civil society to protect these resources and leverage their natural and economic value for the benefit of the country and people who live within these sustainable and productive landscapes. ProParque endeavors to protect these resources and leverage their natural value for the benefit of the people who live among them. We and our partners—The Nature Conservancy, CARE Honduras, and Zamorano University—are collaborating with numerous associates, including the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Honduran Institute of Tourism; and Institute of Forest Conservation, Wildlife, and Protected Areas, among others.

###  Sample Activities

* Analyze tourism, forestry, and agroforestry value chains and identify areas for improvements to [grow local economies][5], create jobs, and increase income for people connected to those industries.
* Identify opportunities for carbon capture, as well as for hydropower, biomass, and biofuel, and develop these renewable energy sources in ways that protect the environment and create jobs.
* Map the roles of those working on behalf of Honduras' protected areas, particularly those in government, and identify points of overlap, gaps, or contradictory purpose, and then deliver recommendations for systemic, procedural, communication, and knowledge management efficiencies.
* Working within the framework of a multidonor initiative, push forward an institutional restructuring of the national protected area management system, including the financial engineering of sustainable resource flows and improved comanagement arrangements between the central government, municipalities, and local communities.

###  Select Results

* Between 2011 and 2014, the project implemented 14 value chain projects, resulting in 3,184 new jobs within the coffee, cacao, rambutan, livestock, and mahogany sectors.
* In the same time frame, nearly 300 people were trained in the methodology of conservation planning while 768 were trained in protected area management.
* More than 3,000 people were trained in disaster risk reduction techniques.
* More than 25,000 people received more energy efficient stoves.
