[ProParque][1] helped the government of Honduras to develop sound management of its natural resources in a way that complemented the country's economic and social development. The project worked with government stakeholders to strengthen the nation's protected area management system, improve biodiversity and natural resource management, and facilitate [rural enterprise growth][2], climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and clean energy development.

Over the course of implementation, the ProParque team worked to improve Honduran biodiversity conservation, create local jobs, and strengthen national capacity for mitigating and adapting to global climate change. Honduras and its Bay Islands have rich natural resources—stunning coral reefs, mangroves, rainforests, [cloud forests][3], mountain ranges, and an abundance of endemic plant and [animal species][4]. ProParque worked side-by-side with the government, private sector, and civil society to protect these resources and leverage their natural and economic value for the benefit of the country and communities in which they are located.

###  Sample Activities

* Analyzed tourism, forestry, and agroforestry value chains and identified areas for improvements to [grow local economies][5], create jobs, and increase income for people connected to those industries.
* Identified opportunities for carbon capture, as well as for hydropower, biomass, and biofuel, and develop these renewable energy sources in ways that protect the environment and create jobs.
* Mapped the roles of those working on behalf of Honduras' protected areas to identify points of overlap, gaps, or contradictory purpose, and then deliver recommendations for systemic, procedural, communication, and knowledge management efficiencies.
* Worked within framework of a multidonor initiative to promote forward an institutional restructuring of the national protected area management system, including the financial engineering of sustainable resource flows and improved co-management arrangements between the central government, municipalities, and local communities.

###  Select Results

* Between 2011 and 2014, the project implemented 14 value chain projects, resulting in 3,184 new jobs within the coffee, cacao, rambutan, livestock, and mahogany sectors.
* Trained approximately 300 individuals in conservation planning methodology and 768 individuals in protected area management.
* More than 3,000 people were trained in disaster risk reduction techniques.
* More than 25,000 people received more energy efficient stoves.
