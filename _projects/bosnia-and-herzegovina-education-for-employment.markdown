Addressing the mismatch between the supply of, and demand for, labour in the country is a core priority for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Although establishing a systemwide skills development sector remains the long-term goal in BiH, progress in implementing countrywide strategies has been constrained by the lack of harmonised coordination across all levels. 

The European Union (EU)-funded programme Education for Employment supports the Government of BiH to increase the responsiveness of its education sector to labour market needs alongside efforts to increase institutional capacities and coordination within the education sector at all levels. The project components include the strengthening of lifelong learning career guidance systems; the further development of qualifications and standards at higher education level; new teacher training programmes at initial and in-service level; and measures to improve human resources development across different levels of the education system.

Our team’s efforts to support improvements in the relevance and quality of education provision will lead to higher levels of attainment of students in high demand skills, including those related to entrepreneurial and digital competencies. In doing so, the project will contribute to higher numbers of successful transitions into decent employment, with an education system that responds to labour market needs at the national and global levels.
