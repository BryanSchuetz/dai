The young generation of today is the largest in history – posing both a challenge and an opportunity for international cooperation and development. Youth are facing important challenges linked to job creation and labour markets, employability, displacement and migration, conflict, violent extremism, impact of climate change, and shrinking spaces for participation and action in general. With its bilateral, regional, continental, and global partners, youth is one of the European Union’s key priorities both within and outside its borders.
The overall objective of the project was to assist European Commission’s Directorate General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA) in identifying best practices for youth actions around the world, with a view to formulate future actions to fill existing gaps and to ensure the largest impact and coherence with other activities. In particular, the thematic areas covered were: youth empowerment and participation; skills development, peace and security, culture, and environment and climate change.  Additionally, the project supported the launch of EU’s Youth Sounding Board, aimed at giving young people a voice on topics related to EU’s development cooperation.

Select results: 
•	Analysed and identified relevant policies and best policy practices supporting and engaging with youth implemented by the EU, EU Member States, and other relevant actors.
•	Formulated recommendations on actions for DG INTPA and the EU to undertake on youth policy.
•	Supported the launch of EU’s Youth Sounding Board, gathering 25 young people from all over the world to provide the EU advice on topics spanning all political priorities. 
•	Supported the consultation process on EU’s Youth Action Plan.
