With more than one billion people around the world living without reliable and affordable electricity, an increasing number of off-grid energy technologies and business models are emerging in an effort to close this global energy access gap. While companies offering off-grid solutions are interested in the world’s most under-electrified areas, they often lack the critical information on market potential, electrical infrastructure, socioeconomic contexts, and energy demand required to make prudent investment decisions.

The Sustainable Business Group designed a methodology to help the World Bank and International Finance Corporation provide investors with the data necessary to better understand the market for off-grid energy, and made that data accessible through a web-based, geo-analytical application. The resulting[ Off-Grid Market Opportunity Tool](http://offgrid.energydata.info/), built by project partner [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/), maps potential hot spots for investment across Sub-Saharan Africa, with additional in-depth, highly localized data for Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia.
