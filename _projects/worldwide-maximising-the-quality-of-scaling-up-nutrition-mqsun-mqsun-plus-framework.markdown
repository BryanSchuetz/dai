DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International is part of a consortium led by PATH that works to increase coverage of effective multi-sectoral programmes to reduce undernutrition in countries that have signed up to the [Scaling Up Nutrition](http://scalingupnutrition.org), or SUN, movement.

MQSUN+ is a five-year programme that provides multi-disciplinary highly qualified expert teams, including nutritionists, economists, statisticians, social economists, and other specialists in key areas such as public health, agriculture and food security, law, social protection, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), education, governance, and gender. 

MQSUN+ builds on the successes of the previous MQSUN Framework Agreement of which Health Partners International was a core implementing partner.

### Sample Activities

* Provide policy and budget cycle management assistance to governments in the SUN Movement and to the SUN Movement Secretariat to catalyse country efforts to scale up nutrition impact. 
* Assist the U.K. Department for International Development to maximise the quality and effectiveness of its nutrition-related programmes.
* Support evidence generation and lesson learning around the global targets to reduce malnutrition.

### Select Results

In the first phase of the MQSUN programme, which ran from 2012 to 2016, we:

* Provided technical support to harmonise nutrition-related indicators, targets, and outcomes across multiple donors and sectors (notably agriculture, education, health and social protection) in support of plans for scaling up nutrition-related interventions in Kenya.

* **[Technical assistance to the SUN donor convenor](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/support-to-scaling-up-nutrition-donor-convenor-kenya/)** to harmonise nutrition-related indicators, targets, and outcomes across multiple donors and sectors (notably agriculture, education, health and social protection) in support of plans for scaling up nutrition-related interventions in Kenya.

* Rapid, reactive and targeted **[technical assistance to Scaling Up Nutrition countries](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/technical-assistance-to-scaling-up-nutrition-countries/)**

* **[Review and costing of national nutrition policies and plans](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/review-costing-of-nutrition-policies-plans/)** to support the leveraging of a global resource commitment for nutrition at the G8 Nutrition for Growth event in 2013

* Design of the DFID nutrition programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Made up of a consortium of seven non-state organisations leading in the field of nutrition and led by **[PATH](http://www.path.org/)**, MQSUN was considered a ‘one-stop shop’ for nutrition programming expertise. MQSUN seeks to enhance the quality of nutrition-related programmes through:

* Expanding the evidence base on the causes of undernutrition

* Enhancing skills and capacity to support scaling up of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programmes

* Providing the best guidance available to support programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

* Increasing innovation in nutrition programmes

* Knowledge sharing to ensure that lessons are shared.
