DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International is part of a consortium led by PATH that works to increase coverage of effective multi-sectoral programmes to reduce undernutrition in countries that have signed up to the [Scaling Up Nutrition](http://scalingupnutrition.org), or SUN, movement.

MQSUN\+ is a five-year programme that provides multi-disciplinary, highly qualified expert teams, including nutritionists, economists, statisticians, social economists, and other specialists in key areas such as public health, agriculture and food security, law, social protection, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), education, governance, and gender.

MQSUN\+ builds on the successes of the previous MQSUN Framework Agreement of which Health Partners International was a core implementing partner.
