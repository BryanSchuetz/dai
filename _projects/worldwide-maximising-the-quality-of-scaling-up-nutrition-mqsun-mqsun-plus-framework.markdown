DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International is part of a consortium led by PATH that works to increase coverage of effective multi-sectoral programmes to reduce undernutrition in countries that have signed up to the [Scaling Up Nutrition](http://scalingupnutrition.org), or SUN, movement.

MQSUN \+ is a five year programme which will provide multi-disciplinary highly qualified expert teams, including nutritionists, economists, statisticians, social economists, and other specialists in key areas such as public health, agriculture and food security, law, social protection, WASH, education, governance and gender. MQSUN \+ builds on the successes of the previous MQSUN Framework Agreement of which HPI was a core implementing partner.

The objectives of this project are to provide:

1. Technical assistance to Governments in the SUN Movement and to the SUN Movement Secretariat to catalyse country efforts to scale up nutrition impact. This objective will strengthen the capacity of 50\+ SUN Movement countries to continuously improve their policy and budget cycle management and to deliver policies and programmes which reduce undernutrition.

2. Technical assistance to DFID to maximise the quality and effective of its nutrition-related programmes, to support evidence generation and lesson learning, and to develop nutrition capacity and support the achievement of global targets to reduce malnutrition.

## MQSUN

HPI was part of a consortium established in 2012 to assist with the urgent task of scaling up DFID nutrition-specific and nutrition–sensitive programmes.

The Maximising the Quality of Scaling Up Nutrition (MQSUN) programme supported the global **[Scaling Up Nutrition, or SUN](http://scalingupnutrition.org/)**, movement and provides technical expertise on the design and implementation of nutrition programmes, drawing on the best available evidence.

HPI provided technical support to MQSUN in strengthening the nutrition enabling environment including:

* **[Technical assistance to the SUN donor convenor](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/support-to-scaling-up-nutrition-donor-convenor-kenya/)** to harmonise nutrition-related indicators, targets, and outcomes across multiple donors and sectors (notably agriculture, education, health and social protection) in support of plans for scaling up nutrition-related interventions in Kenya.

* Rapid, reactive and targeted **[technical assistance to Scaling Up Nutrition countries](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/technical-assistance-to-scaling-up-nutrition-countries/)**

* **[Review and costing of national nutrition policies and plans](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/our-projects/review-costing-of-nutrition-policies-plans/)** to support the leveraging of a global resource commitment for nutrition at the G8 Nutrition for Growth event in 2013

* Design of the DFID nutrition programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Made up of a consortium of seven non-state organisations leading in the field of nutrition and led by **[PATH](http://www.path.org/)**, MQSUN was considered a ‘one-stop shop’ for nutrition programming expertise. MQSUN seeks to enhance the quality of nutrition-related programmes through:

* Expanding the evidence base on the causes of undernutrition

* Enhancing skills and capacity to support scaling up of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programmes

* Providing the best guidance available to support programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

* Increasing innovation in nutrition programmes

* Knowledge sharing to ensure that lessons are shared.
