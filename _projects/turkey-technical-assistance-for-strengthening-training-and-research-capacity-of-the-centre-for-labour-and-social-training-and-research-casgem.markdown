Occupational health and safety (OHS) remains a key concern in Turkey. In 2017, out of 15,676,733 insured employees, 359,653 of them suffered from occupational accidents; 691 reported cases of occupational disease; and 1,636 employees lost their lives. Occupational accidents and diseases cost the Turkish economy approximately €1,66 billion a year.

It is thus imperative that OHS is improved in Turkey. The first phase of the Technical Assistance for Strengthening Institutional Capacity of ÇASGEM programme was implemented between 2015 and 2017 by DAI. Our experience with the Training and Research Centre for Labour and Social Security (ÇASGEM) and in-depth knowledge of its institutional needs guides our experience in implementing the specific intervention for this second phase.
 
This project supports ÇASGEM, medical, and rehabilitation professionals by developing new learning modules targeting to raise their capacity. This will be carried out through involving ÇASGEM in the implementation of capacity building activities necessary to meet the goals on requirements of safety and security in labour and social life. 

### Sample Activities

* Adapt training modules of occupational rehabilitation.
* Develop training modules around safety culture.
* Establish a web-based process and performance management system.
* Design and develop OHS virtual training scenarios.
