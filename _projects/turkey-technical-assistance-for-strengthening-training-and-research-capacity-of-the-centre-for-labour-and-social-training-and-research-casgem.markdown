Occupational health and safety (OHS) remains a key concern in Turkey. In 2017, out of 15,676,733 insured employees, 359,653 of them suffered from occupational accidents; 691 reported cases of occupational disease; and 1,636 employees lost their lives. Occupational accidents and diseases cost the Turkish economy approximately €1,66 billion a year.

It is thus imperative that OHS is improved in Turkey. The first phase of the Technical Assistance for Strengthening Institutional Capacity of ÇASGEM programme was implemented between 2015 and 2017 by DAI. Our experience with the Training and Research Centre for Labour and Social Security (ÇASGEM) and in-depth knowledge of its institutional needs guides our experience in implementing the specific intervention for the second phase of this technical assistance project.
 
This project will support ÇASGEM, medical and rehabilitation professionals by developing new learning modules targeting to raise their capacities. This will be carried out through involving ÇASGEM in implementation of capacity building activities, necessary to meet the goals on requirements of safety and security in labour and social life - to further enlist booming economic climate and private entrepreneurship. Toward assuring this, the project will provide the essential capacity building services to ÇASGEM and other OHS stakeholders.

Sample Activities
•	Adaptation of Training Modules of Occupational Rehabilitation (Return to Work Program)
•	Development of Training Modules to disseminate Safety Culture
•	Establishment of web based Process and Performance Management System
•	Designing and Developing of Virtual Training scenarios in the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)
