Environmental protection has been integrated into Turkey’s development goals since 1998 with the preparation and adoption of NEAP (National Environmental Action Plan) into multiannual development plans. This adoption process has been accelerated since 1999, when the country was officially recognized as a candidate for full EU membership. Turkey has gone through considerable progress in harmonization and implementation of EU environmental acquis. 

Turkey’s Multi-annual Action Programme for Environment and Climate Action (2014-2016) and National Action Plan for EU Accession Phase-II (June 2015-June 2019) clearly state that the industrial pollution sub-sector is crucial for putting EU acquis into practice in the country and transposing the acquis in the field of industrial pollution control and risk management as a closing benchmark. 

The Project “Determination of Industrial Emission Strategy of Turkey in Accordance with Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control” is addressing one of the most crucial environmental issues regarding the protection of human health and environment by integrated management of industrial pollution through the implementation of Industrial Emissions Directive.

### Sample Activities

* Increase the technical and institutional capacity of the competent authorities for effective implementation of IPPC approach in Turkey in line with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive, the most important environmental acquis in terms of effective industrial pollution reduction based on an integrated approach and the use of best available techniques.
* Development of National Action Plan (NAP) for Implementation of IPPC approach defined by IED, and obtaining a strategy document to combine action plans regarding all environmental components (air, noise, water, soil, waste) as a precondition for ensuring the further developments in the environmental field.
* Increase awareness of all relevant stakeholders for a smooth implementation of IPPC approach in Turkey by setting the activities on capacity building as training programs, dissemination of workshops, and study tours aiming for the sustainability of the project and continuity of outcomes beyond the implementation period.
