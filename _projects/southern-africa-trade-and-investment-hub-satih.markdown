When the U.S. Congress and the White House celebrated the reauthorization of the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA) they reconfirmed the United States' commitment to helping Africa become the world’s next major economic success story. Despite major gains in trade and market expansion, however, countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) still face significant obstacles to sustained economic growth. Many member states lack the physical infrastructure along with trade and investment policies to capitalize upon these trade agreements. In addition, cumbersome export/import procedures, high transportation costs, and preferential trade regimes all hinder investment and reduce productivity while negatively affecting the region’s economy, food security, livelihoods, and public health.

The Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, will work to address these barriers and support Southern Africa to create a well-integrated regional economy that delivers tangible economic benefits and improved food security for the people of the region through increased global competitiveness, trade, and investment.

DAI’s approach will include serving as a capacity builder and facilitator, bolstering Southern African institutions’ trade and competitiveness initiatives while also stimulating commercially oriented public-private and private-private partnerships among and between SADC member states, the U.S. government, and African and U.S. companies.
