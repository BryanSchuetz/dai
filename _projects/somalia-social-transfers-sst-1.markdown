Somalia shows signs of slow recovery from 25 years of state collapse, civil war, and political unrest. The country remains highly exposed to poverty, vulnerability, and food insecurity. Humanitarian crises have been particularly severe in 2008, 2011, and 2017, with a major famine taking place in 2011, another narrowly averted in 2017. Following the 2017 draughts, 3 million people became aid-dependent for their survival and international donors began to review their approaches in a new perspective, linking humanitarian aid and long-term development.

The Somalia Social Transfers Phase 1 (SST-1) programme supports the development and implementation of a strategy on social safety net or social transfer system as part of a long-term social protection system.

The project is a component of the wider [Inclusive Local Economic Development programme](https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/region/horn-africa/somalia/inclusive-local-and-economic-development-iled_en) that promotes stability in the country by “extending state authority and services, promoting local reconciliation and peacebuilding, creating inclusive economic opportunities, and protecting the most vulnerable.”

SST-1 provides a technical assistance facility to the Donor Working Group, supporting the dialogue around a social safety net system between donors and Somali institutions. It furthermore supports the government in Somalia in its efforts to set up and implement a forthcoming Social Protection Policy.
