The Partnership for Transforming Health Systems 1 (PATHS 1) supported local initiatives to strengthen government stewardship in health policy, planning and financing; improve management in public health, particularly at local levels; raise quality standards of preventative and curative services, particularly in the areas of malaria, TB, reproductive health and sexually transmitted infections, safe motherhood and childhood illnesses;and raise awareness of people’s entitlement to good quality, affordable care and increase their ability to prevent and manage certain health conditions.

Health Partners International (HPI) was a core part of the implementation consortium and led on providing technical support for systems strengthening and social development activities.

In Nigeria, a traditionally challenging working environment, the PATHS 1 process, aided by early, intensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, was very successful. For example, there was a dramatic increase in the use of district hospitals, the use of emergency obstetric care, and in immunization rates; while in policy, consensus was built around the need for pro-poor and equitable health services.

HPI was directly involved in the following initiatives under this programme and developed the technical briefs and end of programme documentation.
