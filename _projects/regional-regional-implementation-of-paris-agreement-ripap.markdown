Climate change is a global challenge that requires a collaborative response. With the recently concluded Paris Agreement, there is an increasing demand for international cooperation to drive the necessary transformation to more resilient, low carbon economy. The European Union has been implementing ambitious climate policy for decades and has accumulated extensive knowledge to be shared with experts and policymakers in the beneficiary countries. 

The purpose of this project was to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and the development of a resource-efficient, low-emissions and climate-resilient economy in the Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Serbia), and Turkey
 
This intervention supported the beneficiaries to build their capacity for the implementation of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and low emissions development strategies. Additionally, the project enabled regional cooperation through the exchange of information, best practices, experience and awareness-raising between IPA beneficiaries.
