The European Union is financing a support programme worth €65 million to implement an ambitious reform effort of the Government of Jordan—the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) to improve the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) sector.

Our assistance supports sustainable growth through free and equitable access to high-quality primary and secondary education for human capital development. To this end, improving teacher capacity will generate better education for young people, in turn increasing their opportunities for decent work upon graduation and their contribution to economic growth. 

More specifically, this project will support the predominantly young population to seize more easily employment opportunities in Jordan. Special attention is given to those who are in a disadvantaged position, in particular women, refugees, and the disabled. 

### Sample Activites

* Improve governance and strategic planning in the education sector, based on data-driven decision-making through the preparation of a comprehensive capacity development plan.
* Strengthen the overall career path for teachers, focusing on pre-service training in selected grades to adopt and implement modern, student-centered, and inclusive teaching practices.
* Reform vocational education with a specific focus on building up cooperation mechanisms between the Ministry of Education, the new Technical and Vocational Skills Development Commission, and the private sector.
* Raise awareness about the benefits of the EU support in the education sector for the people and economy of Jordan.
