The Responsive Governance (RG) Activity is a four-year initiative to narrow the governance gap between the “two Colombias”—large cities, on the one hand, versus the more isolated and conflict-affected municipalities where RG will work, on the other—resulting in national and subnational governments that are more responsive to citizen needs and more likely to create conditions conducive to peace.
 
Working at the intersection of public financial management (PFM), local governance, and conflict programming, RG seizes a moment of opportunity to promote effective governance and support Colombian institutions and systems as they enter the next phase of peace implementation. With Colombian partner organizations Transparencia por Colombia, Pastoral Social, and Corpovisionarios, RG builds on the decentralization efforts supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Government of Colombia to emphasize visible and sustainable improvements in service delivery and implementation of the Peace Accords.
 
RG works in 27 conflict-affected municipalities.
