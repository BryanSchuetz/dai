The Organisation of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (OACPS) comprises the most vulnerable countries in the world to the adverse effects of climate change. To tackle these vulnerabilities, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA), OACPS is working with its 79 members to enhance their resilience and preparedness to natural hazard risks.

Against this backdrop, the 11th European Development Fund Intra-Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program (11th EDF Intra-ACP NDRR Program) is designed to strengthen the resilience to disasters in the ACP Group of States to reduce the impact of disasters. The present action will provide Technical Assistance (TA) to the OACPS Secretariat to ensure the successful implementation of the 11th EDF Intra-ACP NDRR Program.
The project will contribute to reducing the impact of disasters caused by natural hazards and extreme events as well as building and strengthening the resilience of OACPS Member States. The principal focus of the intervention is to strengthen Disaster risk governance; support the increased investment in disaster risk reduction, and strengthen the mechanisms for effective response, recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction capacities.
Select Activities: 
•	Strengthen the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the 11th EDF Intra-ACP NDRR Program, and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) indicators
•	Increased availability of technical assistance (TA), analytical advice and learning exchange on DRR to OACPS countries
•	Support preparation for and participation of the OACPS countries in post-disaster needs
Assessments (PDNAs) and other post-event assessment and recovery/rehabilitation processes 
•	Coordinate the implementation of strategies for communication and visibility, and knowledge management and for experience sharing under the 11th EDF Intra-ACP NDRR Program
