DAI is helping the European Commission to increase the impact, quality, coverage, and sustainability of social transfer schemes that target food and nutrition security. These demand-driven tailored services are initiated by requests from European Union (EU) delegations to increase the impact, quality, sustainability and coverage of social transfers to address resilience to food crisis and food insecurity, agricultural growth and sustainable agriculture, and under-nutrition.

These services assist countries in: maximising the impact of social transfers on the rural economy and local food production; maximising their impact on maternal and child nutrition; designing and improving complementary measures for graduating from social transfers programmes; and moving from recurrent, as-needed humanitarian transfers to a more systemic approach to national transfers schemes.

The first phase of ASiST ran from January 2012 to October 2013, the second phase from August 2014 to February 2015. These initial phases confirmed the need for, and usefulness of, a more substantial advisory service with a longer implementation period.

For country-specific requests, ASiST provides guidance along various stages of project cycle management, including programme design and monitoring and evaluation. ASiST also provides technical assistance on strategic issues, including the creation of partnerships with other donors and projects, networking and feedback on policy documents, and communications.
