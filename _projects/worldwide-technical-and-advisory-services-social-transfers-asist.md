This project will help the European Commission to increase the impact, quality, sustainability and coverage of social transfers to address food insecurity in partner countries focusing in particular on: resilience to food crisis and food insecurity; agricultural growth and sustainable agriculture; and nutritional status of nutritionally insecure people.

These tailored services will be demand-driven, initiated by requests from European Union (EU) delegations to assist countries in areas such as: maximising the impact of social transfers on the rural economy and local food production; maximising their impact on maternal and child nutrition; designing and improving complementary measures for graduating from social transfers programmes; and moving from recurrent, as-needed humanitarian transfers to a more systemic approach to national transfers schemes.

The first phase of ASiST ran from January 2012 to October 2013, the second phase from August 2014 to February 2015. These initial phases confirmed the need for, and usefulness of, a more substantial advisory service with a longer implementation period.

For country-specific requests, ASiST will provide guidance along various stages of project cycle management, including programme design and monitoring and evaluation. ASiST will also provide technical assistance on strategic issues, including the creation of partnerships with other donors and projects, networking and feedback on policy documents, and communications.

###  Sample Activities

* Assist local EU delegations with support to programming, contributions to training courses, field visits, and participation in national seminars.
* Convene or support regional seminars of EU delegations.
* Develop a knowledge platform for broad exchange and collaboration.
* Communicate the potential and importance of social transfers to a wider audience, creating partnerships and finding synergies among people and institutions, benefiting from each other's lessons learned and building on achievements.
