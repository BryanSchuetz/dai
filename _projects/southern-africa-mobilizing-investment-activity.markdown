Increasing investment supports the expansion of the private sector and catalyze economic growth in the region, which remains challenged by high levels of poverty, unemployment (especially youth unemployment), and inequality.

The Southern Africa Mobilizing Investment Activity promotes inclusive economic growth and self-reliance in the region.
 
The RDCS hypothesizes that increasing investment will support the expansion of the private sector and catalyze economic growth in the region, which remains challenged by high levels of poverty, unemployment (especially youth unemployment), and inequality. DAI will partner with businesses and capital providers to better enable investors and funds to mobilize private capital into sectors with the potential to address these challenges.
 
Led by Chief of Party Robin Padberg and Deputy Chief of Party Hans Balyamujura, the Activity will focus on both increasing investment and expanding the private sector. With our South African partner Ndarama Works, DAI will mobilize catalytic capital to establish sustainable investment flows into sectors previously underserved by investors; develop the capacity of fund managers that would traditionally have difficulty accessing capital; work with businesses and capital providers to identify bankable investment opportunities and perform the necessary due diligence; and facilitate connections between U.S. and Southern African capital providers.
