Increasing investment supports the expansion of the private sector and catalyzes economic growth in the Southern Africa region, which remains challenged by high levels of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. 

The Southern Africa Mobilizing Investment Activity promotes inclusive economic growth and self-reliance in the region. We partner with businesses and capital providers to better enable investors and funds to mobilize private capital into sectors with the potential to address challenges.
 
The Activity focuses on both increasing investment and expanding the private sector. 



## Sample Activities

* Mobilize catalytic capital to establish sustainable investment flows into sectors previously underserved by investors.
* Develop the capacity of fund managers.
* Work with businesses and capital providers to identify bankable investment opportunities and perform the necessary due diligence.
* Facilitate connections between U.S. and Southern African capital providers.
