Many smaller financial institutions (FIs), particularly in low-income or post-conflict contexts, still rely heavily on paper-based systems (e.g., for loan application processes). Digitalization of these processes will introduce controls for risk and likely help foster inclusion in the FIs’ portfolios. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact have crystalized the importance of digitalization for the resilience of FIs and their clients’ livelihoods.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and FMO, the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank, have joined forces in the [DFC-MASSIF COVID-19 Response Co-Financing Facility](https://www.fmo.nl/news-detail/973ab3bf-c499-4d53-8c8b-b40a96640e62/dfc-and-fmo-launch-75-million-co-financing-facility-to-boost-covid-19-response-in-developing-countries). This collaborative effort is designed to support micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

The Digital Transformation Technical Assistance Facility Framework (DTX TAF), funded by the Dutch Development Bank, FMO, seeks to support FIs and agribusiness companies in their digital transformation journey by addressing knowledge opportunities and limitations of their current IT systems, product offerings, and corporate strategy. The TAF will also assist in the development of innovative digital financial products.

The DTX TAF aims to support 10-12 target beneficiaries who offer a wide array of financial services, including, but not limited to, saving products, business lending, guarantees, leasing, and insurance. Beneficiaries will predominately be financial intermediaries (est. 90 percent), particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs) and banks/cooperatives targeting MSMEs. The TAF will also support a small number of agri-businesses (est. 10 percent).

FMO foresees beneficiaries in 10 countries: Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, India, Pakistan, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Indonesia, although this may expand to include any from the complete list of 65 countries that are included in FMO’s MASSIF financial inclusion fund.

The DTX TAF will provide a competitive framework for FMO to efficiently procure specialist digitalization advisory services to selected FIs and agribusiness clients participating in FMO’s DFC-MASSIF Co-Investment Facility.

The DTX TAF will be global but will focus primarily on FIs and agribusinesses in low-income countries and underserved groups like women, youth, and entrepreneurs active in agriculture or rural areas.
