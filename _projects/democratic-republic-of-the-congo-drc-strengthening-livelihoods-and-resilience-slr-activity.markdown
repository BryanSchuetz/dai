The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Strengthening Livelihoods and Resilience (SLR) Activity assists the Government of the DRC to improve the resilience capacities in vulnerable households and communities and support the Congolese people, households, and communities in their efforts to sustainably escape poverty and chronic vulnerability. SLR strengthens systems and institutional capacity; fosters inclusive economic growth and improved livelihoods; improves the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious foods; and promotes gender equity and the empowerment of women and youth.
 
SLR focuses on Ituri Province, a challenging operating environment that routinely suffers significant shocks and stresses—including resource-based conflict (especially over land), disease outbreaks, and severe weather and climate events—that have led to significant food insecurity and chronic vulnerability.
