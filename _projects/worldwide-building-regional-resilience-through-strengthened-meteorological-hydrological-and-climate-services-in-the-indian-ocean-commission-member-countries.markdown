DAI is providing technical expertise to design the “Building Regional Resilience through Strengthened Meteorological, Hydrological, and Climate Services in the Indian Ocean Commission Member Countries” project for consideration to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as part of the [Adapt’Action](https://www.afd.fr/en/adaptaction) framework contract. 
 
Our team assesses country contexts and reviews and analyses relevant documents and data. We will conduct fact-finding missions in Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles, working closely with relevant stakeholders. The information identified and collected during the project feasibility stage will then lead to the development of a full funding proposal as well as relevant annexes for submission to the Global Climate Fund.
  
Working with World Meteorological Organisation staff, this assignment is closely aligned with our [work in Mauritius](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mauritius-enhancing-resilience-to-climate-change).
