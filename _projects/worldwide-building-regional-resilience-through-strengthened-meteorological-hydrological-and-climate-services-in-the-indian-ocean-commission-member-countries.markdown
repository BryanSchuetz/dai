DAI provided technical expertise to design the “Building Regional Resilience through Strengthened Meteorological, Hydrological, and Climate Services in the Indian Ocean Commission Member Countries” project for consideration to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as part of the [Adapt’Action](https://www.afd.fr/en/adaptaction) framework contract. 
 
Our team assessed country contexts and reviewed and analysed relevant documents and data. We conducted fact-finding missions in Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles, working closely with relevant stakeholders. The information identified and collected during the project feasibility stage lead to the development of a full funding proposal as well as relevant annexes for submission to the Global Climate Fund.
  
Working with World Meteorological Organisation staff, this assignment closely aligned with our [work in Mauritius](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mauritius-enhancing-resilience-to-climate-change).

## Sample Activities

* Establish a ‘vulnerability profile’ for each target country, based on an analysis of hydrological and climate-related hazards, communities and livelihoods, and existing meteorological infrastructure.
* Identify gaps and capacity building needs among the national hydrological, meteorological, agrometeorological, and marine services of each beneficiary country and at the regional level.
* Develop complementary studies for the Regional Hydromet Project, namely environmental and social impact assessment, economic and financial feasibility study, gender assessment plan, and action plan.
* Develop a full-scale funding proposal for the Regional Hydromet Project.
