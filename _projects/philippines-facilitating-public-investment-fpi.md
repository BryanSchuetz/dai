 With reform-minded leadership and the commitment of the United States and Philippine governments to transformational change—embodied in their joint Partnership for Growth—the Philippines has a rare opportunity to address some critical fiscal issues. FPI is helping the government of the Philippines increase its fiscal space to enable inclusive economic growth as well as identify synergies between increasing revenue collection and improving the business environment.

The project promotes optimization of public expenditures through results-oriented budgeting and fiscal transparency, eliminating ineffective spending in favor of high-impact programs and public investment in infrastructure, education, technology, and other areas. Our key counterparts are the Department of Finance, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Department of Budget Management, and Bureau of Customs.

###  Sample Activities

* Promote electronic tax filing and payment.
* Build revenue forecasting capacity.
* Assist in the integration of tax-related database systems among pertinent government agencies.
* Build capacity on budgeting, program evaluation, and cost-benefit analysis.
* Support Good Governance and Anti-Corruption transparency initiatives.

###  Select Results

* Expanded the use of e-filing by tax administration. In 2013, only 8 percent of all tax returns were electronically filed. FPI, working in close cooperation with Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), is now expecting that 30 percent of all returns will be submitted electronically in 2015. The BIR plans to further increase the figure to 60 percent in 2016.
* Developed taxpayer guides, relevant regulations, and a related public awareness campaign around e-filing.
* Promoted electronic payments as a primary way of settling tax liabilities in the Philippines. The number of e-payment transactions is expected to increase by about 80 percent—from 0.95 million in 2013 to an estimated 1.7 million in 2015, mostly due to expansion of e-filing via eFPS and related e-payment facilities.
