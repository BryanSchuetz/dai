The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) aims to promote energy-driven low-carbon growth, reduce poverty, and generate new market opportunities for symbiotic U.K. partnerships and investments.

DAI will help the FCO achieve its vision by designing and implementing three enterprise development centres, drawing from similar projects in Canada, [Ghana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-local-content-training), [Guyana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guyana-centre-for-local-business-development), Mozambique, Oman, Suriname, and [Trinidad and Tobago](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/trinidad-and-tobago-local-content-study). The locally run and sustainable centres will leverage local content in the Mexican energy sector to create sustainable energy practices, foster cross-sectoral socio-economic development, and generate UK investment and market opportunities.

DAI's core partners on the project include Wood PLC, OPITO, and Ogilvy.

Kicking off at a time of immense change in the Mexican energy sector, the Energy Services Programme will focus on gender-inclusive interventions to support Mexico’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

### Sample Activities
  
* Develop a local workforce that has the necessary skills and international certifications to meet industry demand.
* Build the capacity of Mexico’s small businesses to better support supply chain integration; and
* Build the capacity of energy regulators and officials to promote best practices in implementing and enforcing regulation.
