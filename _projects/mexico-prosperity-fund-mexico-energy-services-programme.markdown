The U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) aims to promote energy-driven low-carbon growth, reducing poverty and generating new market opportunities for symbiotic U.K. partnerships and investments.

DAI will help the FCDO achieve its vision by designing and implementing three enterprise development centres, drawing from similar projects in Canada, [Ghana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-local-content-training), [Guyana](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guyana-centre-for-local-business-development), Mozambique, Oman, Suriname, and [Trinidad and Tobago](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/trinidad-and-tobago-local-content-study). The locally run centres will leverage local content in the Mexican energy sector to create sustainable energy practices and foster cross-sectoral socioeconomic development. Gender inclusion and sustainability will inform all programme activities.

DAI's core partners on the project include Wood PLC, OPITO, and Ogilvy.

### Sample Activities

* Develop a local workforce that has the transferable energy sector skills and international certifications necessary to meet industry demand.
* Build the capacity of Mexico’s small and medium-sized enterprises to better support supply chain integration.
* Build the capacity of energy regulators and officials to promote international best practices in accountability and transparency and ensure compliance with local content regulations.
