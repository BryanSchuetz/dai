The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office aims to promote energy-driven low-carbon growth, reducing poverty, and generating new market opportunities for symbiotic U.K. partnerships and investments. DAI's core partners on the project include Wood PLC, OPITO, and Ogilvy.

DAI’s Sustainable Business Group team will implement its local business development center model at scale, building on the experience of similar SBG initiatives in Canada, Ghana, Guyana, Mozambique, Oman, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Kicking off at a time of immense change in the Mexican energy sector, the Energy Services Programme will focus on gender-inclusive interventions to support Mexico’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

### Sample Activities
  
* Develop a local workforce that has the necessary skills and international certifications to meet industry demand.
* Build the capacity of Mexico’s small businesses to better support supply chain integration; and
* Build the capacity of energy regulators and officials to promote best practices in implementing and enforcing regulation.
