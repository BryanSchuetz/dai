DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) developed a 10-year Operational Business Plan for the National Institute of Oil and Gas (INPG) in Senegal. SBG worked with a multinational corporation on a comprehensive, holistic strategy to build revenue, shape and train the petroleum industry's future leaders, and create a technical workforce that could compete on a global scale. This investment will strengthen the Senegalese supply base as the country seeks to develop a sustainable and prosperous petroleum economy. 

SBG conducted in-country research to gauge the needs, capacities, and requirements of the Senegalese context and inform a strategy to provide students with the necessary skills  to participate in this growing industry. The plan also included a budget, a timeline, implementation phases for facilities and training courses, and recommendations for organizational structure.
