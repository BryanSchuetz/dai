The Gulf of Guinea and Nigeria/ Niger Delta suffer from major and regular maritime insecurity that range from piracy, armed robbery, or kidnapping to illegal oil bunkering, trafficking, and smuggling.

Our project supports the SWAIMS programme to improve maritime security and safety in the Gulf of Guinea.
