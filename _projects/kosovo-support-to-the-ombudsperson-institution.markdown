The Ombudsperson Institution of Kosovo (OIK) is an independent institution established under the Constitution of Kosovo, responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights complying with the United Nations' standards of the Paris Principles.  

Our project supports the OIK to effectively protect and promote the rights and fundamental freedoms of citizens by enforcement of institutional capacities and the introduction of new tools and methods. It also helps the OIK raise awareness among citizens, public authorities, and civil society on the role of the OIK in the promotion and protection of human rights.

### Sample Activities

* Develop and implement standard operating procedures, internal instructions and guidelines for systems of cases and investigation management.
* Assess efficiency and effectiveness of administrative services.
* Design and implement yearly awareness campaigns targeting the citizens of Kosovo, on the mandate of the OIK and its activities.
* Strengthen the engagement with civil society and grassroot associations through regional events.
* Support the procurement of all required technical supplies that will make the OIK more efficient.
