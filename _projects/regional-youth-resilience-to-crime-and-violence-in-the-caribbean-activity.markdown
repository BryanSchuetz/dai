As the Eastern and Southern Caribbean (ESC) region emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession, more young people have gravitated to crime and violence in the face of high unemployment, exacerbated family tensions, and gaps in public services. Despite this trend, young people in the region are poised to support recovery with greater awareness and demand for change. The U.S. Agency for International Development launched the Youth Resilience to Crime and Violence Prevention in the Caribbean Activity—in Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines—to address this demand and support youth to build more safe, prosperous, and resilient societies.
