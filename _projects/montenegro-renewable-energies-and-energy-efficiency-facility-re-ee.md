A high degree of inefficiency and pollution are major challenges facing the Montenegrin energy sector, besides the necessity of general rehabilitation measures. The economic potential for investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures in Montenegro is high and—due to a lack of information, awareness, and financial means—far from being used to full capacity. DAI established a facility to promote renewable energies and energy-efficiency related investments. DAI, in partnership with Encon Services, was contracted by Kreditanstalt for Wiederaufbau (KFW) to assist in implementation of the RE-EE Facility in Montenegro.

###  Sample Activities

* Facilitate and promote the development of a market for renewable energies and energy efficiency investments in Montenegro.
* Provide training measures for the personnel of the partner bank(s) regarding the extension of loans for renewable energies and energy efficiency investments.
* Assure, in a sustainable manner, an efficient and ecological energy supply in Montenegro is provided.
