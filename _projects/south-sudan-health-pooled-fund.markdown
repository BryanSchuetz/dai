The Health Pooled Fund is a partnership with the Government of South Sudan’s Ministry of Health implemented in two phases (HPF1 – 3 ½ years and HPF2 – 2 years), it 

The Health Pooled Fund focuses on successfully strengthening health systems and delivering essential health services in South Sudan. Crown Agents leads a consortium that includes DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International and Montrose International. Within the fund are 23 other implementing partners that support primary health care services in health facilities, including hospitals, across 55 counties.

The consortium works on four main areas:
Sample Activities

Manage Health Pooled Fund mechanisms through support to the Steering Committee and state and county coordination mechanisms, as well as develop policies, procedures, and guidelines.

Support to health service delivery through contracting, management and performance monitoring of NGO Implementing Partners (IPs)
Health systems strengthening, with emphasis on health sector planning, management and oversight at national and state levels
Management of fiduciary risk for funds under direct HPF control
The HPF is supported by the Australian Government’s Overseas Aid Program (AusAid), the British Government’s Department for International Development (DFID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the European Union (EU), the Swedish International Development and Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
Our consortium’s adaptive programming approach has ensured continuous service delivery throughout the outbreaks of conflict and continuing instability, as well as responding to additional demands from GRSS.

As a result of this, HPF has delivered key achievements including:

Immunising hundreds of thousands of children against preventable childhood illnesses including vaccinating 614, 243 children under 1 year old against measles.
32, 342 women of reproductive age received family planning for the first time, reinforcing their right to determine number/spacing of children and, by preventing unintended pregnancy, reducing number of maternal deaths and infant mortality
736, 814 mothers-to-be attended first antenatal care appointments, with 139, 522 continuing though to fourth antenatal visit
191, 554 women delivered to health facilities and 62% of all deliveries in facilities were attended by a skilled birth attendant resulting in more women getting access to clean, safe and reliable treatment
With female representation of 30% on health committees, we are supporting community health structures and promoting community engagement and ownership of health facilities, a key factor in strengthening the sustainability of services.
As part of the consortium, HPI is leading the Health Systems Strengthening, Gender and Social Inclusion and Community Engagement project work streams.

Health System strengthening technical assistance and support for government has included planning and budgeting, Hospital management, HR and HRIS, HMIS and Supply Chain Management. HPI HSS team approach introduces reforms through a change management process with close attention to contextualised institutional behaviour and ongoing learning-by-doing; as well as building political and institutional commitment to change, with strong local ownership integrated into locally-developed strategic frameworks. HPI has also trained and deployed specialists and officers to be embedded in MoH and State Ministry of Health (SMoH) respectively.

Gender and Social Inclusion been given a special focus in HPF2 and is at the core of programming.  An overall GESI strategy and work plan has been developed to inform HPF 2 approach to integrating gender equality and social inclusion considerations across the programme, through both service delivery and in communities, focussing on institutional change and whole community transformation Our GESI approach also supports the institutionalisation of Gender equality and Social Inclusion into relevant MOH planning and operations.

Community Engagement works with the Health Ministry in developing a uniform approach to community empowerment and community engagement strategies with a special focus on institutional states and counties capacity strengthening. The team also support IPs to strengthen and scale up some of their more successful coordinated approaches in order to bring useful change in the community and a more holistic community health system in the available timescale.

The HPI team is led by Dr Emmanuel Sokpo, an HPI Senior Partner, and works in collaboration with HISP to strengthen the Health Management Information System.
