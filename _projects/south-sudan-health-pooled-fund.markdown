The [Health Pooled Fund](https://medium.com/@HPFSouthSudan), supported by multiple donors, focuses on successfully strengthening health systems and delivering essential health services in South Sudan. Crown Agents leads a consortium that includes DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International and Montrose International. Within the fund are 23 other implementing partners that support primary health care services in health facilities, including hospitals, across 55 counties.

As part of the consortium, Health Partners International leads the Health Systems Strengthening, Gender and Social Inclusion, and Community Engagement project activities.
