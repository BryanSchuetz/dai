Kazakhstan is one of the leading former Soviet countries in the field of public administration. Following independence in 1991, the government implemented a series of economic and political reforms, but in 2005 further improvements were still required to ensure continued progress. DAI worked with the government to develop performance standards and indicators for the civil service in pilot ministries and oblasts; the standards and indicators were later extended across the whole public administration. The overall project objective was to improve public service delivery, making it more responsive to the people, more efficient, and more economical.

###  Sample Activities

* Consult with citizens about their needs.
* Conduct performance surveys and publish their results to enhance accountability.
* Adopt customer service charters to govern the standards of public service delivery in Kazakhstan.
* Establish a pilot one-stop shop to provide administrative services to Kazakh citizens in a cost-effective and timely manner.
