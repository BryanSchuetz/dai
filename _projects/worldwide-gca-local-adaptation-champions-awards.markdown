Launched by [The Global Center on Adaptation](https://gca.org/llachampions/) in 2022, the Local Adaptation Champions Awards spotlight and reward inspiring, innovative, and scalable locally led efforts that address the impacts of climate change and build effective climate resilience among the most vulnerable communities, sections of society, and individuals who are at the frontlines of the greatest existential threat faced by humankind.

DAI supported the delivery of the Local Adaptation Champions Awards 2022 through a range of activities including conceptualizing the Awards process; developing the Awards criteria and material required for the submission of entries; developing a global outreach and publicity plan; building an applications portal; managing the receipt of applications; managing the shortlisting process; and organizing a high-level Awards ceremony at COP27, Egypt.

DAI's social impact and climate expertise have enabled the competition to attract high-quality climate champions from climate-vulnerable countries and attain global reach, culminating in a successful awards ceremony at COP27".\

* Knowledge and capacity—Initiatives designed to strengthen local knowledge and skills related to climate change adaptation, climate finance, or locally led adaptation principles in ways that enable local actors to autonomously continue building their knowledge and share their skills over time.
