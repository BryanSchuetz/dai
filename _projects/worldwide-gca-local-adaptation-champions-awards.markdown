**Awards Categories**

* Inclusive leadership—Initiatives inclusive by design and truly owned by the communities in which they have been implemented.
* Financial governance—initiatives whose scope was to design innovative financial mechanisms that allow local communities to access and manage adaptation funds in ways that best fit local needs, priorities, and evolving contexts.
* Knowledge and capacity—Initiatives designed to strengthen local knowledge and skills related to climate change adaptation, climate finance, or locally led adaptation principles in ways that enable local actors to autonomously continue building their knowledge and share their skills over time.
* Local innovation—Local solutions or technologies—physical or digital—that minimize the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change on people in the community, in particular those most vulnerable.

**Prizes and Awards Ceremony**

Twenty nominees will benefit from media coverage around their nomination for the Awards. Four winners (one per category) will receive a cash prize of €15,000 from a high-level jury in November, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, during [COP27](https://sdg.iisd.org/events/2021-un-climate-change-conference-unfccc-cop-27/).
