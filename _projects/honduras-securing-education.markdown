One of the most abhorrent obstacles to Honduran students’ success is violence in and around schools. School-based violence (SBV) hinders the academic achievement of youth and can lead to life-long negative behavior that impacts Honduran society. Preventing SBV is critical to enabling at-risk youth to stay in school, leading to better academic outcomes, improved lives, reduced crime, and stronger local economies.

The Asegurando la Educación (Securing Education) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is helping 115 schools establish cultures of nonviolence, inclusion, and respect. The project partners with education systems and communities in target municipalities to make schools safer places for students and teachers and empowering schools to play a larger role in decreasing community violence.

Asegurando la Educación works across multiple levels: improving schools’ ability to prevent violence; [strengthening local networks](https://eccnetwork.net/peer-violence-bullying/) that increase school safety; and building the capacity of the Ministry of Education and social service agencies to respond to school-based violence. By taking a comprehensive, adaptive approach that involves teachers, students, administrators, community members, and policymakers, the program works to enhance education and job opportunities for youth, while [increasing peace and security](https://www.baselgovernance.org/blog/el-salvadors-rule-law-election-deserves-our-support-heres-how) in communities.
