A major impediment to Honduran students’ success is violence in and around schools, which can lead to life-long negative behavior that impacts Honduran society and beyond. Preventing that violence is critical to enabling at-risk youth to [stay in school](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/safe-learning-spaces-in-honduras-curb-undocumented-migration), contributing to better academic outcomes, improved lives, reduced crime, and stronger communities.

The Asegurando la Educación (Securing Education) program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is helping 115 schools establish cultures of nonviolence, inclusion, and respect. The project [partners]((https://eccnetwork.net/peer-violence-bullying/)) with education systems and communities in target municipalities to make schools safer for students and teachers while empowering schools to play a larger role in [decreasing community violence](https://www.baselgovernance.org/blog/el-salvadors-rule-law-election-deserves-our-support-heres-how).
