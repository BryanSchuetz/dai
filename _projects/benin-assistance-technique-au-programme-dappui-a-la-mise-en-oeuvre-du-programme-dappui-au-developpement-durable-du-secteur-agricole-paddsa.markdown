The project provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (APRM) for the implementation of the Programme d’Appui au Développement Durable du Secteur Agricole (PADDSA), a €70 million initiative to reform Benin’s agricultural sector.

The technical assistance is combined with complementary support delegated to the Belgian Technical Cooperation, which ensures the capacity building of local stakeholders. PADDSA’s complementary support mechanism ensures the coherence of interventions designed planned to reform the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries sectors in Benin. 

Our project team focuses on building the capacity of institutions involved in steering sectoral policy, consolidating the national agricultural statistics and information systems, and improving the general framework for financing agricultural development.
