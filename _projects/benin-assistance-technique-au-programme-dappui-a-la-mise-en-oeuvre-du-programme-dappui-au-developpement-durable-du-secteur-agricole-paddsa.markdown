The project provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (APRM) for the implementation of the Programme d’Appui au Développement Durable du Secteur Agricole (PADDSA), a €70 million programme to reform Benin’s agricultural sector. 

The technical assistance intervenes together with complementary support delegated to the Belgian Technical Cooperation, which ensures the capacity building of local stakeholders. This complementary support mechanism of PADDSA ensures the overall coherence of the interventions planned to reform the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries sectors in Benin. It does so by reconciling the specific support to be provided to central, concentrated, and decentralized bodies, as well as to professional and sectoral actors.

Our project team focuses on capacity building for the institutions involved in steering sectoral policy, consolidating the national agricultural statistics system and agricultural information systems, and improving the general framework for financing agricultural development.
