summary: Formal commercial actors are needed to sustain and expand agricultural value
  chains. Poor farmers, either individually or within groups, cannot effectively penetrate
  international and formal markets without the formal intermediaries involved in quality
  management, bulking, and export.

In Northern Mozambique, small-scale farmers dominate agricultural production but work at subsistence level. In alignment with priorities of the Mozambican government, the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation is promoting development of inclusive market systems, also known as Making Markets Work for the Poor. InovAgro aims to increase small farmers’ revenue by facilitating sustainable changes in the agricultural market.

The second phase of InovAgro started in January 2014 and aims to assist 15,000 poor farmers—including 6,000 women—living in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia. On, average, these target beneficiaries have six members in the households, grow at least three food crops, and have no land titles. InovAgro will build up the capacity of seed companies and input suppliers to drive extension services to these and other smallholders. The project works with five value chains: soya beans, pigeon peas, groundnuts, sesame, and maize.

###  Sample Activities

* Identify and analyze value chains in which the private sector provides avenues for smallholder participation, such soybean, sesame, groundnuts, pulses, and agricultural inputs.
* Build strong supporting service markets (such as seed and agricultural input supply, farm mechanization, and extension services) that respond to the needs of the poor, including introducing new technologies, such as ICT-based reporting, to enhance large firm engagement with small farmers.
* Promoting national policy dialogue on the seed industry to address market failures and lead to increased effective demand for certified seed by small farmers matched with a growth in the supply of commercially marketed certified seeds.
* Facilitate ways for private-sector partners to improve the viability of their supply chains and build linkages to small-scale outgrowers and business development services.

###  Select Results

* Working in partnership with one of Mozambique's largest integrated poultry operations, African Century Agriculture (ACA), Inovagro facilitated the structuring of relationships between ACA and small and emerging farmers in Gurue district of Zambezia province, including the development of an extension services program managed by ACA.
* In the 2012/13 planting season 1,364 farmers (25 percent women-owned and managed farms) farmers cultivated soya and pigeon peas with improved seeds earned a gross income of US$1,123,776 and a net income of US$624,31 and commercial financing worth US$160,000 was provided for inputs and labour. This represented an 18.5 percent increase in net profit by the farmers from the previous season.
* Working with local and regional research institutions, INOVAGRO facilitated the multiplication of new varieties of soya bean seed, which led to 175 tons of cheaper certified seed being sold to small farmers in the 2013/2014 season and assisted the seed company to engage directly with the farmers to sell the seed.
* In April 2014, INOVAGRO hosted a national seminar on the seed sector, leading to the creation of the National Platform for Seed Dialogue, which comprises key stakeholders in the Government of Mozambique, the private seed multiplication and distribution industry, and international donors and research services.
