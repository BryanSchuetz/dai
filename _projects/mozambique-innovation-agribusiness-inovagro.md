Formal commercial actors are needed to sustain and expand agricultural value chains. Poor farmers, either individually or within groups, cannot effectively penetrate international and formal markets without the formal intermediaries involved in quality management, bulking, and export. Under the right conditions, these formal commercial actors can expand their businesses in ways that generate employment and market opportunities for poor communities and farming households. INOVAGRO is working to help them do that.

In the four-year second phase, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is reducing poverty in northern Mozambique by promoting the principles of the market development approach, also known as Making Markets Work for the Poor (M4P). This approach to inclusive private sector development is increasing the economic involvement of the poor in select agricultural value chains, and also addressing nationwide policy issues that constrain pro-poor development. The project mandate is to work in the northern provinces of Mozambique, which despite having the greatest agricultural opportunities, have been hardest hit by rural poverty.

###  Sample Activities

* Identify and analyze value chains in which the private sector provides avenues for smallholder participation, such soybean, sesame, groundnuts, pulses, and agricultural inputs.
* Build strong supporting service markets (such as seed and agricultural input supply, farm mechanization, and extension services) that respond to the needs of the poor, including introducing new technologies, such as ICT-based reporting, to enhance large firm engagement with small farmers.
* Promoting national policy dialogue on the seed industry to address market failures and lead to increased effective demand for certified seed by small farmers matched with a growth in the supply of commercially marketed certified seeds.
* Facilitate ways for private-sector partners to improve the viability of their supply chains and build linkages to small-scale outgrowers and business development services.

###  Select Results

* Working in partnership with one of Mozambique's largest integrated poultry operations, African Century Agriculture (ACA), Inovagro facilitated the structuring of relationships between ACA and small and emerging farmers in Gurue district of Zambezia province, including the development of an extension services program managed by ACA.
* In the 2012/13 planting season 1,364 farmers (25 percent women-owned and managed farms) farmers cultivated soya and pigeon peas with improved seeds earned a gross income of US$1,123,776 and a net income of US$624,31 and commercial financing worth US$160,000 was provided for inputs and labour. This represented an 18.5 percent increase in net profit by the farmers from the previous season.
* Working with local and regional research institutions, INOVAGRO facilitated the multiplication of new varieties of soya bean seed, which led to 175 tons of cheaper certified seed being sold to small farmers in the 2013/2014 season and assisted the seed company to engage directly with the farmers to sell the seed.
* In April 2014, INOVAGRO hosted a national seminar on the seed sector, leading to the creation of the National Platform for Seed Dialogue, which comprises key stakeholders in the Government of Mozambique, the private seed multiplication and distribution industry, and international donors and research services.
