summary: Formal commercial actors are needed to sustain and expand agricultural value
  chains. Poor farmers, either individually or within groups, cannot effectively penetrate
  international and formal markets without the formal intermediaries involved in quality
  management, bulking, and export.

In Northern Mozambique, small-scale farmers dominate agricultural production but work at subsistence level. In alignment with priorities of the Mozambican government, the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation is promoting development of inclusive market systems, also known as Making Markets Work for the Poor. InovAgro aims to increase small farmers’ revenue by facilitating sustainable changes in the agricultural market.

The second phase of InovAgro started in January 2014 and aims to assist 15,000 poor farmers—including 6,000 women—living in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia. On, average, these target beneficiaries have six members in the households, grow at least three food crops, and have no land titles. InovAgro will build up the capacity of seed companies and input suppliers to drive extension services to these and other smallholders. The project works with five value chains: soya beans, pigeon peas, groundnuts, sesame, and maize.
