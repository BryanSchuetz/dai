Malaria is a serious public health problem in rural Zambia, particularly affecting children under 5. A variety of delays and barriers to successful treatment for severe malaria mean that incidence rates in Central Province between 2013 and 2015 were 495 per 1,000 children under 5 years.

The MAMaZ Against Malaria project addresses the lack of access to quality commodities for case management of severe malaria in rural Zambia.

The project aims to increase access to community-based pre-referral treatment for severe malaria for children from six months to under six years old, and to reduce referral delays from the community to health facilities that are equipped to treat severe malaria.

The goal of the project is to devise an evidence-based and sustainable strategy for improving the access of hard-to-reach communities to effective treatment for severe malaria.

The project is working to generate evidence to show that it is feasible to provide pre-referral treatment for severe malaria in the communities and improve case management of severe malaria at lower-level health facilities.

MAMaZ Against Malaria is using a health systems and operational research approach to address the constraints that limit knowledge of severe malaria at community level and access to quality medical drugs which undermine effect case management.

### Sample Activities

* Increase access to severe malaria commodities in remote areas.
* Intervene at the community level to reduce barriers and delays in treatment-seeking and increase patient completion of referral.
* Intervene at the facility level to optimize case management for severe malaria.
