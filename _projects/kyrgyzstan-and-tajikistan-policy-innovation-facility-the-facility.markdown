Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan face similar economic challenges in a fragile region. Both countries are seeking to develop policies to diversify their economies into higher value products, improve microeconomic stability and reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. The governments of both countries have set out high-level economic strategies that will require realistic policies, strategies, and plans to improve their economies, governance, resilience, and delivery capabilities.
 
The technical assistance facility provides flexible, short-term, demand-driven support for policy development and capacity building to the governments of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The Facility works with executive offices, ministries, state agencies, and local government (MDAs) to help formulate policies that contribute to the economic development and prosperity of both countries. The facility will provide opportunities for synergies with another DAI-implemented project, the Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan Enterprise Innovation Programme (EIP). 
 
While technical assistance (TA) projects will help unlock better use of public, private and development partner finance for downstream implementation, the Facility will not support the implementation of policies, strategies, or programmes.
