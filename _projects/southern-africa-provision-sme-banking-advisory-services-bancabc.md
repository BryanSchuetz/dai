BancABC is a pan-African financial services group that operates in five countries: Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The bank is developing a new business line focused on retail banking and lending to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

ABC Bank recently obtained a $13 million loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to strengthen the capital base of its Zambia, Mozambique, and Botswana operations. This will give the bank the capacity to expand into the micro and small business market segments. DAI is helping BancABC build efficient and profitable operations to this end that will increase financial intermediation. This will help diversify BancABC's portfolio with a new viable business line as well as support MSMEs to realize their full potential and make a larger contribution to each country's gross domestic product.
