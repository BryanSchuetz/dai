DAI today launched a new corporate office in Muscat, Oman. DAI Oman will initially focus on DAI’s sustainable business practice, working with commercial and government clients to ensure that their economic investments yield sustainable and mutually beneficial “in-country value” by better incorporating local content, local labor, local services, and local enterprises.

The Oman office will quickly expand to offer the full range of DAI’s global development services in the Gulf region and beyond.

“We are absolutely thrilled to expand DAI’s global footprint here in the Sultanate,” said DAI Oman Managing Director Chris MacDonald, a five-year resident of Muscat and a 30-year veteran of the oil and gas industry. “Oman is a global leader in the field of in-country value and an ideal location from which to deliver services that directly benefit the citizens of emerging market economies.”

The DAI Sustainable Business Group is one of the world’s pre-eminent exponents of in-country value or “local content” programming, designing and implementing a diverse set of projects primarily but not exclusively in the oil, gas, and renewables industries, where the scale of operations means that the rewards in terms of social and especially employment impact can be particularly high.

> “If we are to achieve ambitious development objectives such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we must leverage the power of the private sector, whose investments in emerging markets—with all the associated jobs, contracts, services, and tax revenues—dwarf what international donors are able to provide,” said **Jim Boomgard, DAI President and CEO.** 

“In this context,” he added, “generating in-country value is very much the next frontier in development innovation. DAI is well equipped to advance that frontier, and in doing so we intend to learn from our Omani friends who have already made in-country value a national priority and a national strength, and we hope to make DAI Oman an Omani enterprise capable of deploying Omani expertise in domestic and international markets.”
