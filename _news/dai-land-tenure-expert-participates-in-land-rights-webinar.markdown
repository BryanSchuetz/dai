DAI recently collaborated with [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/)’s Future of Property Rights program and [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) to provide insight into the implementation experience of the [Feed the Future Tanzania Land Tenure Assistance (LTA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/tanzania-feed-future-tanzania-land-tenure-assistance-lta) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

The webinar, [part of a tech and transparency series](https://landportal.org/event/2019/07/webinar-tech-and-transparency-democratizing-data-and-empowering-communities-cutting), explored how better and more prolific technologies can increase transparency and empower communities to map and register their property—a critical enabling factor for better land tenure security and administration by responsible government counterparts.

DAI’s Mustapha Issa, Field Program Director for LTA, sat on the panel amongst other sector experts to share experiences on how new and emerging technologies have improved the potential to increase transparency by simplifying the process of mapping, recording, and maintaining land administration records at scale. Mustapha brought insight into how LTA has utilized USAID’s [Mobile Application to Secure Tenure (MAST)](https://www.land-links.org/tool-resource/mobile-applications-to-secure-tenure-mast/) in mapping and adjudicating land parcels on village land. The application is a suite of tools and methods that uses mobile technology and a highly participative process between village elders, residents, youth, women and marginalized groups and has resulted in 60,000 registered parcels to date with almost equal ownership between men and women.

In addition, the mobile system is designed to be compatible with a web-based system for post registration transactions using the [Technical Register Under Secure Tenure (TRUST)](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/beyond-boundaries-how-secure-land-tenure-is-improving-lives-in-rural-tanzania). Both systems are simple and cost effective. Certificates of Customary Rights of Occupancy (CCROs) can now be produced at under $10 per CCRO whereas they previously cost more than $40 each, in addition to increasing transparency, and streamlining the process of issuing CCROs at scale.

Mustapha also shared the key conditions for effective land registration and administration and factors that have contributed to LTA’s success. He noted that “technology must not only be cost effective but also user friendly and secure with the data easily accessible and transparent—this, combined with a highly inclusive process by trained, gender-sensitive facilitators give the user confidence in the system and increases the likelihood of uptake.” All of these factors must be underlined by political will to transform the status quo into a system that works better for everyone, and new technologies must work within the legal framework for a country to be successful and ensure transformation.

In 2018, USAID awarded LTA a [Digital Development Award](http://www.digitaldevelopment.org/feed-future-tanzania-land-tenure-assistance) for the innovative use of MAST technology, which was expanded to develop TRUST to manage and secure post registration transactions. The tools and technologies used on the LTA project have increased access to finance for small farmers, reduced conflict over property, and opened a new market for buying and selling land.
