DAI is pleased to announce it has signed on as a participant in the [United Nations Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/), the UN’s global sustainability initiative for corporations. 

Created in 2000 with the idea that a business can be a force for social good, the Global Compact is the world’s largest network of organizations committed to sustainable business practices. Signatories commit to align their strategies and operations with [principles](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles) on human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption, as well as work to advance the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).

As a participant, DAI’s membership goes beyond signatory status, signaling greater commitment and giving DAI the opportunity to pursue more meaningful collaborations with other Global Compact members. DAI’s work supports every SDG and through its participation in the Global Compact, it will focus on four:

* Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere.
* Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.
* Goal 6: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.
* Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies.

“DAI stands firmly behind the principles and goals of the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Kurt Olsson, vice president of global strategic marketing. “Participating in the Global Compact allows us to highlight our own innovative solutions while engaging with others working in this space. Through this initiative we can magnify our impact at a critical time of expansion in our organization.” 

Global Compact members operate in various sectors in more than 160 countries worldwide. Nearly 13,000 organizations, including more than 9,500 companies of various sizes, have joined. Benefits of participation include opportunities to attend various UN and Global Compact events, facilitated partnerships and targeted advising and resources.
