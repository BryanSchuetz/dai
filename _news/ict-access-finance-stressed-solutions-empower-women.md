At the DAI-hosted [lab][1] at this year's European Development Days, participants were challenged to come up with creative ways of economically empowering women in developing countries. Among some of the solutions discussed were: promoting the use of information and communications technology to help more women access business financing; training banks to cater specifically to female customers; taking advantage of women's abilities to network; and encouraging donors and governments to facilitate women's participation in local and global value chains.

The brainstorming session—called "Women's Economic Empowerment through Public-Private Partnerships"—followed remarks by speakers including [Janet Nkubana][2], the co-founder of Rwanda-based Gahaya Links; Alex Thier, the Assistant to the Administrator for Policy, Planning, and Learning at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and DAI's Anne Simmons-Benton and [Katja Silva-Leander][3].

"The lab brought together the insight from a real private sector success story and cross-fertilized ideas from two donors (USAID and DFID) to actualize the Paris Declaration principles to create replicable solutions," said Simmons-Benton.

Development Days, the annual forum in Brussels organized by the European Commission, was attended by 5,000 practitioners, heads of state, and global development decision makers.
