Technology and innovation ought to shape the work being done in developing countries but are not being sourced or scaled in ways that meet key development challenges, according to DAI's [Kristi Ragan][1], Chief of Party for USAID's [Grand Challenges for Development][2].

Collaboration with the private sector can lead to commercializing technologies that are changing lives in Africa. "Mobile phones and the Internet, for example, are a force multiplier for gathering ideas and delivering solutions," said Ragan, a featured panelist at New York University's Stern School of Business' inaugural [Stern Africa Forum.][3] "Their use should be integral to international development projects, but too often are afterthoughts."

Ragan helped lead the panel discussion, "Africa's Crossroads: Intersection of Public, Private, Non-Profit Approaches to Africa's Emergence," at the February 23 event in New York City. The panel included experts in structuring large-scale deals for Africa that promote higher education and small-scale investment in agribusinesses.

The forum was themed "Redefining Africa: Innovative Business and Frontier Investments in Emerging Africa" and featured keynote speaker Adebayo Ogunlesi, chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, a New York-based $5.6 billion investment fund.

Ragan, a longtime leader of DAI's [public-private partnership ][4]initiatives, spoke of successes and failures in public-private partnerships and of a new vision for crowd-sourcing solutions and ideas that could include roles for the private sector—including venture capitalists and private equity.
