DAI recently hosted a number of events to raise funds for the Linda Norgrove Foundation, a grant-giving trust that provides funding for women, families, and children in Afghanistan, focusing on education, health, childcare, and scholarships to help Afghan women go to university.

The events—a Cocktail Hour, Workout Wear Friday, a Raffle, and our annual 5k Run/Walk—raised a total of $5,453.77.

This year, we are grateful to a host of local race sponsors, including Bethesda Bagels, Bethesda Smiles Dentistry, Honest Tea, La Madeleine, and Spring Mill Bread Co. Raffle sponsors were Bethesda Deli, Mamma Lucia's, and the Middle East Institute.

The [foundation ][1]was set up after the death of Linda Norgrove, a DAI employee who was kidnapped September 26, 2010, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, and died October 8 during a rescue attempt by U.S. forces. Norgrove was working on the [Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives for the North, East, and West ][2]Program.

The foundation has distributed more than £1 million to help women and children affected by the war in Afghanistan. It has funded almost 50 [projects ][3]including orphanages that care for some of the country's most disadvantaged disabled children, homes for widows, education for girls, and emergency medical help for abused women.

Every year, across the globe, [runs, and other events][4] are held around this time of year in honor of Linda.
