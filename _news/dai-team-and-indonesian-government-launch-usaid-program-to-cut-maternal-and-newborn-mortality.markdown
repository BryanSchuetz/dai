Indonesia’s maternal and newborn mortality rates remain stubbornly higher than in neighboring countries—this despite Indonesia’s fast-rising economic power and substantial development in the past 15 years. Approximately 90,000 newborns or new mothers die each year in Indonesia. In response, DAI, IntraHealth International, and our partners have launched a five-year program bringing together Indonesia’s public and private sectors with local communities to co-create strategies that will reduce death rates among mothers and their newborns.

Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), [the Jalin project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-jalin) will target West Java, Central Java, East Java, Banten, North Sumatra, and South Sulawesi—all provinces prone to elevated maternal and neonatal death rates—as well as communities in Eastern Indonesia. Led by Chief of Party Michelle Folsom, the Jalin team—in cooperation with Indonesia’s Ministry of Health—will collect evidence from these provinces, identify the causes of high mortality rates and constraints to progress, and then collaborate with Indonesian partners to create, implement, and scale solutions. Jalin will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical referral system and work with public health professionals, insurance providers, and policy makers to be more responsive to the needs of patients.

“This is a unique assistance program in that it will support the Ministry of Health and Indonesian communities to save the lives of women and babies by using real-time data to inform locally-driven solutions,” said Folsom. 

DAI’s Jalin consortium, based in Jakarta, includes:

* **IntraHealth**—a DAI [strategic affiliate](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-intrahealth-join-forces-to-amplify-global-health-impact) with particular expertise in health systems strengthening and health workforce development. 
* **Vital Strategies**—a global leader in vital statistics and social autopsy. 
* **MarketShare Associates**—a woman-owned business expert in integrating gender and pro-poor inclusion strategies.
“DAI has a solid record of achievement across many sectors in Indonesia,” said [Christopher LeGrand](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/leadership/christopher-legrand), president of [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/health). “We have put together a really creative team for this forward-thinking initiative, and as a team we are eager to get to work with our government partners.” 

## Parlaying Indonesia’s Development Gains

In recent years, Indonesia has reduced child mortality by prioritizing children’s lives in its national policy and public investment decisions, and it has capitalized on economic growth to scale key health interventions. Jalin plans to build on these trends while looking for opportunities to close gaps and remove constraints to progress.

For example, much of the Government of Indonesia’s health allocations remain underinvested at provincial levels. In addition, Indonesia’s private sector is seeking investment opportunities, and in certain cases these opportunities coincide with promising health benefits, such as expanding health insurance or enhancing telecommunications, financial services, and transport.

Based on recent evidence reviews, USAID identified six technical focus areas likely to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes: quality of care, referral systems, local governance, financial protection, defining and reaching the poorest and most vulnerable, and evidence utilization. Jalin will explore these and other areas to accelerate progress and foster the uptake and expansion of successful efforts.

<quote>The Government of Indonesia continues to make reducing maternal and newborn mortality a top priority in its 2015-2019 National Mid Term Development Strategy and has committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals for maternal and newborn health by 2030.

## The Right Combination

DAI’s interdisciplinary consortium brings to Jalin rich experience and fresh perspectives. IntraHealth will deliver technical health system and services leadership using data-driven approaches such as those it has applied to improve maternal and newborn health care by frontline health workers in [India](https://www.intrahealth.org/vital/walk-through-maternal-health-care-rural-india-msakhi#.V_UwHvkrKCi) and strengthen the medical referral system in the [West Bank](https://www.intrahealth.org/news/a-better-medical-referral-system-leads-to-huge-cost-savings-for-the-palestinian-people-). Vital Strategies will research vital statistics to inform Jalin activities, as it currently does with Indonesia’s Ministry of Health through the Bloomberg Data for Health initiative. MarketShare Associates will ensure gender integration and provide additional assistance in targeting the most vulnerable populations.

DAI’s expatriate and local national staff—many of whom have worked in Indonesia for decades—have delivered innovative solutions in areas including natural resources management, agricultural development, water and sanitation, and governance. For Jalin, DAI will draw from the experience of programs such as USAID’s [Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-urban-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-iuwash) (IUWASH) project, which employs various tools and systems to deliver results for the most vulnerable. IUWASH uses data from the Social Protection Program dataset and the Village Potential Survey, for example, to identify areas with the highest density of poor and women-headed households, thereby maximizing impact in those groups.

In Indonesia DAI is also currently implementing [Adaptasi Perubahan Iklim dan Ketangguhan](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-apik-adaptasi-perubahan-iklim-dan-ketangguhan-or-climate-change-adaption) (or Climate and Disaster Resilience), the [Mitra Kunci Initiative](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-mitra-kunci-initiative) workforce development program, the [ASEAN-U.S. Partnership for Good Governance, Equitable and Sustainable Development and Security](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southeast-asia-asean-us-partnership-good-governance-equitable-and-sustainable), and the [Preparedness and Response Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr).
