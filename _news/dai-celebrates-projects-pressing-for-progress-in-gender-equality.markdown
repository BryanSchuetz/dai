This International Women's Day, March 8, DAI will press for further progress by hosting an internal panel of DAI gender experts to debate future programming and by externally highlighting women's successes from our work around the globe. Read our stories on Facebook and Twitter using the #PressforProgress hashtag. 

DAI integrates gender programming across all our services: design, research, monitoring and evaluation, assessments, and implementation, as well as through our staffing of projects. We draw not only on tool kits, research, and theory—valuable as those things are—but on more than 40 years of field experience of what works, what does not, and why. Our holistic approach is founded on culturally sensitive techniques that create real change for women and men.

We are currently implementing the single largest gender program for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Afghanistan, called Promote: Women in the Economy (WIE). Together, WIE and DAI-led Musharikat represent the largest single effort under USAID's Promote indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract. 

In the Middle East, we are implementing a first-of-its-kind project to stimulate increased women's economic empowerment and agency through a market systems approach for the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and the Islamic Development Bank.

Our gender experts from WISE Development are addressing gender-based constraints in northern Ghana, researching how to enable women's economic empowerment in northern Nigeria, undertaking a scoping assignment for the Open Society Foundation and developing gender guidelines for the Ethical Trading Initiative.

Around the world and across all sectors, DAI presses for progress in gender equality in all projects, regardless of their specific emphasis on gender. From increasing female political participation in Sri Lanka, to greater access to clean water and sanitation in Indonesia, to promoting women entrepreneurs' access to finance across East Africa, and preparing women for careers in health care in Nigeria, DAI actively elevates women's advancement worldwide
