DAI was recently selected as one of six holders of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s YouthPower Implementation Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ). YouthPower is USAID's platform for implementing and scaling up positive youth development programs globally.

Designed to bring USAID's [Youth in Development Policy][1] to life—emphasizing youth engagement and cross-sector collaboration, while approaching youth holistically in the context of their families, communities, and countries—YouthPower will tackle diverse design and implementation issues, with a lens on young people as decision makers and problem solvers.

The DAI team members—CID, Digital Opportunity Trust, E-Line Media, Integra Government Services, JBS International, Program for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH), Promundo, and World Education—are recognized leaders in the sectors fundamental to youth development: youth engagement, life skills development, literacy and education, workforce development, entrepreneurship training and support, health and mental health, countering violent extremism, and crime and violence prevention. Our team also has cutting-edge expertise in the use of technology to maximize program impact, including creative use of text messaging, social and new media, and digital gaming to engage youth in learning and leading.

DAI brings to YouthPower a proven ability to deliver holistic programming and multidisciplinary approaches integrated across sectors including economic growth, gender, health and nutrition, environment, and governance.  

"For many years, we have been working with youth in the context of broader economic growth and effective governance programming, and fostering youth participation in their communities," said Sherry Youssef, DAI's YouthPower IDIQ Manager. "YouthPower allows us to better focus on this important demographic that literally holds the future in its hands in every country where USAID works."
