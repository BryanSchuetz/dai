DAI is pleased to participate in the [7th EU-Africa Business Forum](https://www.euafrica-businessforum.com/), taking place online from February 14–18. The forum brings together African and European Union (EU) business leaders and political decision-makers to discuss the investment climate and increase economic partnership opportunities between the EU and Africa. The forum will be followed by the [EU-Africa Summit](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2022/02/17-18/) on February 17–18. 

On February 14, from 10 to 10:45 am CET, [Bhairav Raja](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bhairav-raja), Director of Responsible Business at DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business), will contribute to a workshop on circularity in African Union-EU fashion and apparel trade and investments, organized by the [European Centre for Development Policy Management](https://ecdpm.org/) and [Msingi](https://www.msingi.com/). The workshop will feature a public-private dialogue on how to promote an inclusive circular economy transition in textiles in Africa and Europe. It will provide a platform to showcase examples of innovative circular approaches and partnerships in Europe and Africa and explore ways to support that through effective policies.
