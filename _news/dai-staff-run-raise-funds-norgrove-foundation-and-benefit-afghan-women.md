DAI is following the lead of the Linda Norgrove Foundation by organizing events to mark the first anniversary of our late colleague's death and raise money for the foundation.

Many DAI staff are participating in a 5-kilometer run/walk on October 8 in Bethesda, Maryland, the same day as the Valtos 10K run in Norgrove's native Isle of Lewis, Scotland. Other running events to benefit the foundation are being organized worldwide. DAI staff who are running in the October 30 Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C., are collecting pledges for the foundation from friends and coworkers.

The [Linda Norgrove Foundation][2] has raised more than Â£330,000 to help women and children affected by the war in Afghanistan. It was a cause dear to Norgrove, who for years worked with dedication on development projects in Laos, Peru, Uganda, and elsewhere to benefit disadvantaged people. She was kidnapped in September 2010 in Eastern Afghanistan while working on a DAI project to boost local economies and create jobs. She died on October 8, 2010, during the course of a rescue attempt.

The foundation, established by Linda's parents, John and Lorna Norgrove, especially seeks to support education and incomes for Afghan women and widows in order to bring about lasting change for the country. So far the foundation has issued grants to fund the purchase of beds, tents, sports equipment and toys for children, literacy and mathematics lessons, bread ovens, childbirth education, and winter clothing. DAI is dedicating staff time in Afghanistan to identify beneficiaries for the foundation and ensure successful grants.
