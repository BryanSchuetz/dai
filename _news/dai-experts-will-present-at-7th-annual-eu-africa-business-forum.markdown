DAI is pleased to participate in the [7th EU-Africa Business Forum](https://www.euafrica-businessforum.com/), taking place online from February 14–18. The forum brings together African and European Union (EU) business leaders and political decision-makers to discuss the investment climate and increase economic partnership opportunities between the EU and Africa. The forum will be followed by the [EU-Africa Summit](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2022/02/17-18/) on February 17–18, focusing on sustainable value chains. 

On February 14, from 10 to 10:45 am CET, [Bhairav Raja](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bhairav-raja), Director of Responsible Business at DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business), will contribute to a workshop on circularity in African Union-EU fashion and apparel trade and investments, organized by the [European Centre for Development Policy Management](https://ecdpm.org/) and [Msingi](https://www.msingi.com/). The workshop will feature a public-private dialogue on how to promote an inclusive circular economy transition in textiles in Africa and Europe. It will provide a platform to showcase examples of innovative circular approaches and partnerships in Europe and Africa and explore ways to support that through effective policies. 

Throughout the week, DAI also will showcase the [EU Support to Policy Dialogue on Investment Climate](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/somalia-eu-support-to-policy-dialogue-on-investment-climate) in Somalia project through a booth at the forum. The project is working to enhance the investment climate and business environment by improving access to finance, markets, and essential services for medium, small, and micro enterprises in the country.
