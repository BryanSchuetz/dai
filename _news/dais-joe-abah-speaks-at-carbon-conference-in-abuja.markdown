The inauguration of the Carbon Chamber Project (CCB) by the National Chamber Policy Centre of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) presented a valuable opportunity for DAI to engage with Climate Change decision makers and green energy technology companies about programs and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate development efforts.

Country Director, Dr Joe Abah, explained the dependencies between climate change, poverty reduction and clean energy, his speech highlighted how renewable energy can reduce poverty and strengthen the Nigerian economy if effectively harnessed.

Nigeria is home to 2.6 per cent of the world’s population and is only responsible for 0.26 per cent of global emissions. Low-income households bear the most brunt of climate impacts and this has placed the nation among the ten most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards. 
“Nigeria experienced a double shock of severe drought in the northeast and widespread flooding that affected nearly the entire country in 2012. The floods caused nearly $17 billion in damages and losses in the 12 most affected states. Climate change inaction could cost Nigeria between 6 per cent to 30 per cent of income by 2050, equivalent to a loss of US$100-460 billion” Joe Abah
Rapid increase in urbanisation and urban poverty also escalates climate risk with an estimated 24 per cent of Nigeria’s population (approximately 41 million people) living in high climate exposure areas.
For many years, DAI has led great work in climate adaptation & mitigation around the world. In 2021, DAI collaborated with the Rural Electrification Agency of Nigeria (REA) to facilitate the provision of clean, safe and reliable energy with focus on rural communities in Nigeria. The evidence based, practical and actionable recommendations drawn from the partnership improved the capacity of the agency to delivery inclusive renewable energy solutions. 
While the need for alternative energy sources remains in focus, more efforts and strategies should be put in place for people and businesses - especially those in rural areas who rely on electricity to thrive. This will ultimately drive development, reduce unemployment and increase the nation’s revenue. 
“Electrifying rural communities is absolutely the best way of moving people out of poverty’’ Joe Abah
