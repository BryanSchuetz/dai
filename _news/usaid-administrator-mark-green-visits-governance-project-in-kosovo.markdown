U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Mark Green recently visited the Municipality of Pristina Procurement Office in Kosovo, to discuss developments in procurement and transparency. Green learned about recent reforms in local governance and improvements in procurement systems that have made them more transparent and increased accountability. Opening of the public contracts, the increased usage of electronic procurement system, and increased cooperation with the civil society were the highlights of the meeting. All these achievements are as a result of DAI-implemented project in Kosovo, namely the Transparent, Effective, and Accountable Municipalities activity in Kosovo. Mr. Green highly appreciated municipality’s commitment and the project’s work to improve processes safeguarding public funds.

During the meeting, the Mayor of the Pristina Municipality, Shpend Ahmeti, while informing the group about the reforms, highlighted the impact and the support of the USAID-funded [Transparent, Effective, and Accountable Municipalities](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kosovo-transparent-effective-and-accountable-municipalities-team) activity, led by DAI. Ahmeti also shared his thoughts via social media by saying, he “…was pleased to welcome the Head of USAID, Mr. Mark Green, to the Municipality of Prishtina. We had the opportunity to discuss governance reforms, including procurement and transparency. We thank once again the TEAM project with whom we are working on a daily basis to establish systems to protect public money.”

Green also visited the upgraded archive and the office bid opening and evaluation, an investment co-financed by the Municipality of Pristina and USAID TEAM. The new archiving system will help municipal procurement officers to secure and access procurement records, promoting the municipality’s ability to manage effectively their own documents and reducing the possibility that individuals could inappropriately access and tamper with procurement records. Similarly, new cameras installed in the procurement and archive offices increase the level of security for vital municipal records. New equipment for bid evaluation and bid opening helps the municipality to modernize and professionalize these key procurement processes. 

DAI, through TEAM, supports efforts of the Government of Kosovo to modernize public procurement and limit municipal vulnerability to corruption. By strengthening procurement processes and controls at the municipal level, the project helps local governments safeguard public funds and deliver better quality public services to citizens. The project works in partnership with municipalities, central government institutions, independent agencies, and civil society to achieve breakthrough change in procurement transparency and accountability.
