The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has named DAI its USAID Large Business Partner of the Year in recognition of the firm’s work with small businesses in 2017.

USAID selected DAI based on its success in partnering with U.S. businesses as subcontractors, both domestically and overseas. Specifically, in FY 2017 DAI awarded $12.5 million of its subcontract dollars on USAID projects to small and disadvantaged businesses.

In making the award, USAID praised DAI’s “significant utilization of small business contractors in critical roles in the implementation of USAID programs. Your firm’s commitment serves as a great example in partnership and mentorship for the development and growth of small businesses.”

The conference enables small-businesses to meet with USAID and its implementing partners to learn about federal contracting and working with USAID and its Missions. USAID Acting Deputy Administrator David Moore made the presentation.

“We are honored to win this award,” said DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard. “Partnering with the right small businesses enriches our proposals, strengthens our technical work, and introduces new ideas and approaches into the DAI bloodstream. We put a great deal of thought and effort into our small business engagement program, and it is gratifying to see it recognized in this fashion.”
