Environmentally safe building materials are widely available and can significantly reduce pollution over their life cycles. But green-certification for these materials should be standardized to facilitate their trade between countries and promote their increased use, according to Dana Kenney, a senior consultant with DAI's [Environment and Energy Sector][1].

In a presentation last week to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Green Buildings Conference in Singapore, Kenney outlined the tools available to conduct Life-Cycle Assessments (LCA) of the environmental impact of building materials. She also reviewed which nations require procurement of certified products, discussed market drivers for certified products, and explained the potential impact of certification programs on trade.

"Government procurement requirements are beginning to play a significant role in promoting the market for certified products," Kenney said. "Consumer demand and government commitments in various economies are at the heart of growing demand for these certification programs."

APEC commissioned two case studies on green building through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Officials from APEC's 21 Pacific Rim member nations attended the event.

The DAI/Nathan Group prepared the studies, one by Kenney titled "[Multi-Attribute LCA-Based Certification Programs in APEC Economies: Focus on Flooring and Plumbing Products][2]," and one by independent consultant Dr. Cynthia A. Lowry titled "[Green Commercial Building Rating Systems in the APEC Region][3]."
