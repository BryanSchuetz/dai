DAI hosted four fundraising events this month for the [Linda Norgrove Foundation](https://lindanorgrovefoundation.org/), a grant-giving trust that provides funding for women, families, and children in Afghanistan, focusing on education, health, childcare, and scholarships to help Afghan women go to university.

The events—an Executive Happy Hour (where DAI executives fashion their own cocktails), Tone-Up Tuesday Dance Lessons, Penny Wars, and our annual 5k run/walk—raised $5,153.

This year, the funds will go toward supporting Rustam High School, a Hazara community school located in a remote part of Yakawlang province in central Afghanistan. Rustam High School is the only high school in the area with a greater demographic of girls than boys. These girls are achieving high academic success with 92% of the children, most of whom are from illiterate households, having graduated and gone to university. The funds will be used to address access to clean water, electricity resources, rugs, and general school supplies. 
The foundation was set up after the death of Linda Norgrove, a DAI employee who was kidnapped September 26, 2010, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, and died October 8 during a rescue attempt by U.S. forces. Norgrove was working on the Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives for the North, East, and West Program.
The foundation has distributed more than £500,000 to help women and children affected by the war in Afghanistan. It has funded almost 50 projects including orphanages which care for some of the country’s most disadvantaged disabled children, homes for widows, education for girls, and emergency medical help for abused women.
Every year, across the globe, runs and other events are held around this time of year in honor of Linda.
