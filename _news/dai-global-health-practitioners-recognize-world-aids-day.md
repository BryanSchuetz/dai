[World AIDS Day][1] is held every December 1 and is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate people who have died. It was first was held in 1988.

According to the World Health Organization, between 2011–2015, World AIDS Days has the theme of "Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths." The theme "signifies a push towards greater access to treatment for all; a call for governments to act now. It is a call to honor promises like the Abuja declaration and for African governments to at least hit targets for domestic spending on health and HIV."

Global health practitioners from around the world, including those from DAI, are taking part in the World AIDS Day 2012 campaign by raising awareness.

The slideshow depicts the goals and aspirations of our global health practitioners, as well as team members of our project in Tanzania who work to strengthen households that are affected by HIV/AIDS. The project, Economic Strengthening for Households Affected by AIDS (IMARISHA), is part of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Staff members of a local grantee of IMARISHA, BRAC Maendeleo Tanzania, are also pictured. BRAC Maendeleo is supporting about 600 HIV-vulnerable girls in Dar es Salaam with life skills training.
