When the U.S. Agency for International Development's Frontiers in Development Forum kicked off September 18 in Washington, D.C., a DAI team was there to help address the forum's driving question—"_How will we eradicate extreme poverty by 2030?"_

A follow-on to the inaugural 2012 forum, [Frontiers][1] convened some of the brightest minds and boldest leaders on ending extreme poverty and laying the groundwork for a broad coalition of committed partners. This major event featured global leaders such as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and included two days of discussions, high-profile talks, and interactive panels. There was also an Innovation Marketplace as well as numerous concurrent focus sessions.
