[USAID Prevent](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/peru-prevent)'s [Consecuencias](http://www.consecuencias.pe/) campaign, which seeks to raise awareness among young people about environmental crimes in the Amazon, has won the 2024 Eikon International Award, in the social marketing category. This honor is the second Eikon award that the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded project has received for the Consecuencias campaign and the project’s third overall, having won the 2023 National Environmental Award.

The Consecuencias Award recognizes the campaign for its innovative approach to the use of entertainment and music to raise awareness among young people of the three main environmental crimes in the Peruvian Amazon: illegal logging, mining, and wildlife trafficking. Delivered with support from multiple partners, the campaign also catalyzes public and private contributions to advance environmental crime prevention, generating alliances amounting to almost $1 million so far. 

The Eikon International Awards are organized by the Argentine magazine *Imagen* and recognize excellence in communication in Latin America. In this edition, more than 410 entries were evaluated. The award will be presented on November 19 in Buenos Aires.
