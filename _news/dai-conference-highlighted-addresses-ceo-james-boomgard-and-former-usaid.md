The DAI Global Staff Conference launched Monday, October 3, convening more than 600 staff from DAI headquarters in Washington and London and from project locations all over the world.

On Tuesday, guest speaker Rajiv Shah, photo left, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2010 to 2015, and a current Distinguished Fellow at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, noted that "we work in tough, fragile, and difficult settings far away from here because it is in [the United States'] interest and because it is a reflection of our values."

Shah discussed international development and how it will change moving forward based on science, technology, innovation, and private sector investments, which are critical to scaling results, as well as the experience of organizations working in fragile states where extreme poverty, violence, and injustice too often stifles human growth and opportunity.

DAI President and CEO James Boomgard then delivered the keynote, which reaffirmed the centrality of DAI's development mission to the company and its employee owners. "Development is the reason we do everything that we do at DAI," he said. "It has always been that way, and I intend for it to always be that way."

The DAI Global Staff Conference continued Wednesday and Thursday, with panel discussions and workshops delving into political economy analysis, domestic resource mobilization, resiliency, innovation, ICT, global health climate change, land tenure, and countering violent extremism, among more than 80 sessions on the agenda.
