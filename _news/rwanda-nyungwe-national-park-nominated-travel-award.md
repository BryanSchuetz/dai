Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park has been nominated by the British Guild of Travel Writers (BGTW) to receive an award for "Best Overseas Project/Attraction."

The park is being supported by a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded, DAI-led project called [Strengthening Sustainable Ecotourism in and around Nyungwe National Park (SSENNP)][1]. The goal of the project is to foster inclusive ecotourism development for the benefit of the surrounding communities and to leverage private sector investment in management, construction, and maintenance of new and existing park infrastructure.

The project hosted a group of travel writers back in May and as a result of that trip, in September, the guild voted for the annual tourism awards and the park was voted as one of the top three destinations.

The winner will be selected and announced November 4 at a dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London, the night before the start of the 2012 World Travel Market.This is an excellent opportunity for additional international media exposure for the park.

The BGTW is one of Britain's leading professional organizations for those in the fields of travel writing, photography, editing, and broadcasting. Each year, the guild hosts an awards gala dinner on the eve of the World Travel Market to recognize outstanding global tourism products and journalists' coverage of them.
