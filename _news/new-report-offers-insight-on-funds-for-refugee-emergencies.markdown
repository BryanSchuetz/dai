Refugee crises around the world are growing in scale and severity, with a record 70 million people displaced by conflicts and catastrophes worldwide. To provide life-saving aid in these emergencies, humanitarian groups need efficient, effective, and sustainable sources of funding.  

A new report, produced with the support of DAI and released in June, provides fresh solutions on [innovative financing for current and future refugee crises](https://www.disasterprotection.org/innovative-financing-for-refugee-crises). The report lays out a vision for how new financing systems can ensure funds are available to respond to changing global refugee situations.

The report is a partnership of the U.K. government’s Centre for Disaster Protection, the U.K. Department of International Development (DFID), and the International Refugee Committee’s (IRC) Airbel Center. DAI provided [expert advisory services](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-eacds) to DFID to develop case studies, organize innovation labs around the subject, and produce the final report: [Innovative Financing for Responses to Refugee Crises](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c9d3c35ab1a62515124d7e9/t/5d0b61769ef45800017f84aa/1561026937904/Innovative+Financing+for+Responses+to+Refugee+Crises.pdf). The labs took place in 2018, one in New York and one in London. In preparation for the labs, DAI produced a series of case studies to inform participants.  

Worldwide, every two seconds a person is forced from his or her home by persecution or conflict, according to the report. The financial challenges facing the organizations that provide shelter, food, protection, and livelihood opportunities to displaced people are intensifying. 

Among the innovative financing structures discussed in the report: [parametric insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance) and risk pools, [catastrophe bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_bond), asset-backed securities such as collateralized debt obligations, development impact bonds, and challenge funds. 

Applying these techniques before and during refugee emergencies could increase funding levels, make funding more quickly available and longer lasting, and allow for more efficient use of public capital, the report concludes. These instruments could also provide financial incentives to low- and middle-income countries to host refugees. 

What made the fact-finding process behind the report unique, said [Cathy Shaw](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/cathy-shaw), who managed the work for DAI, was its ability to get experts from so many different sectors to offer solutions. In particular, private sector participants contributed new ideas about how risk financing could be applied to global development and humanitarian aid. 

The Centre for Disaster Protection and its partners will use the report to inform discussions at the first Global Refugee Forum in late 2019.
