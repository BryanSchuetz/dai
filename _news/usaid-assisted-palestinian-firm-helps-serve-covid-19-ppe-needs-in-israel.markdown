A Palestinian clothing maker assisted by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has pivoted to producing surgical masks and other personal and protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

[UniPal 2000](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-transform-factories-into-mask-manufacturing-plants-as-virus-spreads/)'s factory in the Karni Industrial Zone in Gaza City has set a goal of producing 25,000 masks per day. According to the [Middle East Monitor](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200327-palestinians-manufacturing-masks-for-israel-instead-of-clothing-as-coronavirus-spreads/?fbclid=IwAR32G-aTRD7QHURKVtve6VKUK5xVb9KUL4I-TZW4Nohv6zJC1Vft9luVdz8), UniPal Chairman Nabil Bawwab said the company made the transition at the beginning of March and has been producing thousands of masks and protective suits daily. He said he has already signed contracts with Israeli business partners to provide 1 million masks and 50,000 protective suits by the end of April. The company is also in talks with local and international medical organizations in Gaza to supply them products, too.

In 2018, DAI worked with UniPal as a grantee of the USAID-funded [Compete](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/palestine-compete-project) project. Compete worked with key Palestinian sectors to help them better compete in regional and global markets. Targeted sectors in the West Bank and Gaza included agribusiness, tourism, information and communications technology, stone and marble, fishing, and garments. 

UniPal was one of 20 garment companies from Gaza that DAI helped to recapture market share in Israel after 10 years of being out of the market, said [Said Abu Hijleh](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/said-abu-hijleh), DAI Country Director in Palestine. “We provided UniPal with a grant to upgrade and maintain their old machinery, which had been idle for 10 years. We also provided them with a power generator to enable production in Gaza.

 “The company quickly became one of the largest exporters,” added Abu Hiljeh. “By the end of 2018, they constituted 27 percent of total exports to the Israeli market out the 20 firms we assisted in the garment sector. They employed an additional 34 employees—and they have grown since then to the point where they are now able to adjust production to meet COVID-19 needs.”

USAID Compete came to an end  in 2019. In its seven years of operation, the program assisted 1,797 firms in the West Bank and Gaza, increased their sales by $383 million, boosted exports by $254 million, created more than 6,900 jobs, and leveraged $105 million in private-sector investment.
