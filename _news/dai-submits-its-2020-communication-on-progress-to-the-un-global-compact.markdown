DAI Submits Its 2020 Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact

DAI is delighted to submit its latest Communication on Progress to the United Nations Global Compact. 

The Compact is a “voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles,” with a mission to “mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want.” Member companies align their strategies and operations with 10 principles covering human rights, labor rights, environmental sustainability, and ethical business practices, and seek to advance social progress as articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DAI joined the Compact in 2018.

“This year—DAI’s 50th anniversary—turned out to be perhaps the most extraordinary year in our half century of operation, thanks largely to the COVID-19 pandemic but also to an energized movement for racial and social justice that has particular salience for any organization committed to human welfare and global citizenship,” writes DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard in his introduction. 

“The livable world at the heart of DAI’s mission is, of course, inconceivable in the absence of a habitable planet,” Boomgard continues. “Even as we come together to fight the most lethal pandemic in a century, responsible companies must increasingly turn their attention to a pervasive threat that will remain the world’s biggest challenge long after COVID-19 has become a manageable disease: that threat is climate change.”

DAI looks forward to advancing the SDGs through almost 200 projects over the next 12 months and to reporting our progress in due course.
