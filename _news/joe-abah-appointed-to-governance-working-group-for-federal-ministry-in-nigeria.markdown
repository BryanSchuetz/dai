The Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning Ministry has appointed DAI's Nigeria Country Director, Dr. [Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah), as a member of the Governance, Institutions, Administrations of Justice, Anti-Corruption and National Orientation Technical Working Group for the preparation of the Nigeria Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP) 2021–2025 and the Nigeria Agenda 2050.
 
In 2009, the Federal Republic of Nigeria set some ambitious objectives, including to become one of the top 20 economies in terms of gross domestic product by 2020. The framework of initiatives to deliver this objective was called Nigeria Vision 20:2020. To bring the country out of a recession in 2016, a medium-term Economic Recovery and Growth Plan was developed to restore Nigeria’s economic growth.
 
The Nigeria Vision 20:2020 and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan will lapse in December, and the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning has convened teams of technical experts to prepare their successors: Nigeria Agenda 2050 and the Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP) 2021–2025.
 
The Ministry has identified 26 thematic areas of the economy and established Technical Working Groups to integrate them into the national planning process. These working groups include technocrats from government, the international development community, and the private sector with expertise in national development. Abah recently participated in the Virtual Inaugural Ceremony.
 
The groups have the mandate to prepare a broad-based macroeconomic framework to facilitate the development of the Nigeria Agenda 2050 and MTNDP; improve on the initial work of the Ministry’s technical staff; review the assumptions, parameters, and forecasts for the previous macroeconomic frameworks for Medium-Term Plans and Annual Budgets; and identify and employ suitable macroeconomic models for the Nigerian economy.
