DAI today announced that it has formed a partnership with Magister Advisors, a specialist investment bank, to create [DAI Magister](https://www.daimagister.com/).
 
DAI’s majority investment expands the array of tools at DAI’s disposal to support development in emerging and frontier markets, enabling DAI to directly connect growing, equity-hungry businesses with investors through Magister’s advisory business. DAI Magister will build on DAI’s global platform, local partnerships, experience operating across 150 countries, and in-depth market knowledge.

“We are thrilled to welcome Magister into the DAI family,” said DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard. “Our partnership is a marriage of complementary strengths: Magister’s expertise as a capital advisor in developed and emerging markets, and DAI’s global reach and deep local partnerships in these exciting but challenging economies. Integrating our global platforms will allow us to mobilize commercial capital in emerging markets by connecting growing businesses and their existing investors with financial investors from across the globe. It will drive enterprise growth, accelerate development, and ultimately advance our mission to shape a more livable world.” 

Based in London, Magister has a strong record of executing large financings and M&A deals across Europe and Africa. “I am immensely proud of the track record and franchise we have built and the many companies and CEOs we have advised, and we will continue to provide a world-class service to our clients going forward, while expanding our geographic and product offerings,” said Victor Basta, who founded Magister Advisors in 2012 and will continue as CEO and Chairman of DAI Magister. 

“In DAI, we have found a partner of broad international reach and uncompromising integrity and commitment to global development,” added Basta. “We look forward to making DAI Magister a success both across Europe and emerging markets.”
