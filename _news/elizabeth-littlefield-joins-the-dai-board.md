![Elizabeth Littlefield](/uploads/littlefield-featured-news.jpeg){:.float-left} DAI is honored to welcome to its Board one of the development community’s most distinguished leaders, Elizabeth L. Littlefield. 

Ms. Littlefield—who most recently served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)—brings to DAI more than 30 years of expertise in development finance, economic development, conservation, and poverty reduction. 

“Given the ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals, it’s clear that mobilizing funding and engaging the private sector must be at the heart of our development mission,” said Betsey Nelson, Chair of the DAI Board. “There is literally no one better qualified to guide DAI in these areas than Elizabeth Littlefield.”

> “I’m delighted to join a truly global and forward-thinking development company,” said Littlefield. “As a new member of DAI’s Board, I’m excited to work alongside Betsey Nelson, my fellow directors, and the many hundreds of DAI’s employee-owners on the big issues of our time and the big opportunities on our horizon.” 

Littlefield spent the first 17 years of her career with investment banking and advisory firm JP Morgan, including as Managing Director of capital markets and financing in emerging Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Early in her time at JP Morgan, she demonstrated her commitment to international development, living and working in West Africa to help local communities launch microfinance institutions.

In 1999, Littlefield took a joint appointment as Director of the World Bank's Financial and Private Sector Division and as CEO of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), serving from 1999 to 2010.

In 2010, President Obama appointed Littlefield to lead OPIC, where she served until 2017, managing a $23 billion portfolio to support private U.S. investment in more than 100 developing countries. During her tenure, she reoriented OPIC to emphasize renewable energy—especially solar and wind—impact investing, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

She also served on the White House Global Development Council and the President’s Export Council. And in 2012 she was awarded the U.S. State Department's Distinguished Service Award, the highest award in the Foreign Service. 

A member of The Council on Foreign Relations, Littlefield currently serves on the boards of The World Wildlife Fund, The Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, and the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, and she chairs the board of M-KOPA, Africa’s leading pay-go solar company. She was the founding chair of the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance and a founder of the Emerging Markets Charity in the United Kingdom.

“We are humbled and excited that Elizabeth has joined the DAI Board,” said Jim Boomgard, DAI President and CEO. “She brings to DAI a life-long commitment to making the world a better place and a long-held conviction that the private sector is central to our development aspirations. Her insights will make us a better company.”
