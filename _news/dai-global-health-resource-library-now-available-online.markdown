DAI Global Health is pleased to make available a [Resource Library](/resource-library) showcasing global health publications from DAI authors and projects, including peer-reviewed articles, technical briefs, and infographics. 

> “Our aim is to inform thinking in the global health field and share lessons learned for the public good,” said Eva Rahman, Head of Strategic Communications and Marketing for DAI Global Health. “The library is a work in progress, and we look forward to curating a repository of information and experience that will be of practical use to global health professionals.”

The searchable database includes key legacy documentation from two decades of work by Health Partners International, a DAI Global Health predecessor company, in addition to ongoing learning from a portfolio of initiatives in global health security and pandemic preparedness, digital health, and health systems strengthening, among other disciplines.
