In celebration of World Food Day, held every year on October 16, in commemoration of the founding of the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1945, the [Food and Enterprise Development (FED)][1] project is collaborating with ChildArt Liberia, a local nongovernmental organization, in a competition called "Agricultural Cooperatives—Key to Feeding the World."

Catering to 8- to 18-year-old artists from middle schools in each of FED's six areas of operation, the competition will portray scenes of kids and families growing food together.  The contest will be held in concert with other World Food Day events and activities organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Liberia-based FAO chapter.

Participating students have been given art supplies, including pencils, watercolor, crayons, and pen and ink, taught drawing and painting techniques, and educated on the competition's theme. The artwork for each county will judged on technical skill, creativity, and successful incorporation of the theme. First, second, and third place winners will be awarded cash prizes, while all participants will be recognized for their contribution.

The goal of the competition is to increase awareness of FED activities among youth and families, using creative learning processes to promote the production and consumption of Liberian food.

The FED project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and part of the Feed the Future Initiative, aims to increase agricultural productivity of rice, cassava, vegetables, and goats, increase private enterprise growth, and expand Liberian technical and human resources. Vital to FED's tasks is the meaningful involvement of youth in agriculture and business development in order to prepare them to participate more fully in economic development and food security.

"These children are the future of Liberia," said Jonathan Greenham, FED Team Leader. "How they view agriculture is very important. They need to think about agriculture not just as a potential for feeding themselves, but also their country."
