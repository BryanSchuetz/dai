John Maris, DAI’s Director of Project Management in Europe, has been elected Chair of British Expertise International’s (BEI) Development Aid Working Group. BEI is a U.K. business organization comprised of more than 200 companies that offer consulting and professional services internationally. Its Development Aid Working Group hosts information-sharing sessions, discussions on industry trends, and workshops on best practices in international development. He will be Chair for a one-year term.

“Cross-sector learning and the identification of shared interests is vital to success in international trade and development,” Maris said. “By fostering the delivery of high-quality technical assistance, the Development Aid Working Group directly benefits its members and their clients, while promoting the export of British professional services.”

Maris has been with DAI since 2013 and previously served as Senior Vice President for Programs at Relief International, where he managed program design and implementation as well as technical assistance. He has worked for private equity firm H.I.G. Capital, the corporate strategy department of The Walt Disney Company, and for tech startup Aeromesh. At DAI Europe, Maris leads the Programme Management Unit, overseeing more than 100 projects in more than 25 countries throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

“DAI has always sought to share our expertise and the lessons we learn as we deliver projects. The Development Aid Working Group is a great way for DAI to show leadership in our sector and meet our commitment to give back,” he said. 

Maris holds a master’s in business administration from the University of Oxford and a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University.
