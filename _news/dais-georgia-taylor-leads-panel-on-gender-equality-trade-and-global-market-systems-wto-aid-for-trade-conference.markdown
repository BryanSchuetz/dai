[Georgia Taylor](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/georgia-taylor), Technical Director at DAI Global Health, will lead a discussion on promoting women’s economic empowerment and justice in global market systems at the [Aid for Trade Global Review 2019](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/a4t_e/gr19_e/gr19programme_e.htm) in Geneva on July 4. 

Collectively, with more than six decades of professional experience in gender, women’s economic empowerment and livelihoods, the panel of Women’s Economic Empowerment and Justice (WEEJ) and gender experts will discuss the most challenging barriers to equity, economic agency, and financial security for female participants in market systems. 

Women play a key role in market systems in low- and middle- income economies, as producers and vendors of goods and services and as consumers. Despite this, says Taylor, women face limited economic opportunities as a result of social norms and gender dynamics. “They are more vulnerable to financial risk and shocks and less equipped to be resilient in the face of economic disaster compared to men,” says Taylor.

Our panel, session 76, asks, “How can we protect the economic rights of women globally and overcome these gendered socioeconomic barriers?” 

DAI has a corporate commitment to systematically challenge and transform damaging power relations and gendered practices that perpetuate discrimination, violence, and drive poverty and instability. For example, DAI and the European Commission’s [DEVCO](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/general_en)’s C4 unit have co-created an Innovation Lab focused on gender mainstreaming and WEEJ and DAI is currently implementing [50 projects globally](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/gender) with a WEEJ component. 

The event is led by DAI’s WISE Development, specialists who support international agencies, governments, and nongovernmental organisations to drive gender equality and sustainable change in the lives of women and girls globally.
