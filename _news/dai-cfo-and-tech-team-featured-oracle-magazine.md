DAI's use of technology in global development field work—and in back-office functions—has been profiled in an in-depth article in Oracle's quarterly publication.

DAI's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Haggerty, Vice President of Information Management and Technology [Larry Campbell][1], Afghanistan Agricultural Credit Enhancement Program Chief of Party [Juan Estrada-Valle][2], and Jordan Fiscal Reform Project II Deputy Chief of Party Christina Erickson are quoted about the ways Oracle products increase efficiencies and help keep track of important data that show impact.

In [Jordan][3], in partnership with the government and other partners, Oracle's E-Business Suite and a government financial management information system are assisting the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, government audit bureau, and other government departments in managing data better and cutting out waste from their operations.

"The system vastly improves the government's ability to manage its cash and borrowing requirements, root out improper financial practices and procedures, and safeguard budget ceilings from being exceeded," said Erickson.
