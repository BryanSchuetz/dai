Kate Hargreaves’ 20-year career spans social accountability and transparency, public financial management, and global health; her recent focus has been on climate change and renewable energy. She is passionate about accelerating just transitions to green economic growth, which includes promoting the role of women in solar energy, localizing development by incorporating citizen voice and demand and building community resilience to climate shocks.

"Action on climate change is essential to sustaining economic growth and human development gains,” she said. “I’m a keen advocate for just transitions to achieve Net Zero, which are crucial for successful global development and long-term economic growth for all. Locally led development that includes women and other disadvantaged groups is also key to this transition. DAI is in a great position to help achieve this through our work providing technical assistance and finding and facilitating practical climate and environmental solutions."    

Joe Phillips brings extensive technical experience in trade and investment to DAI, complemented by strengths in team leadership, business development, strategy, and project implementation. 

"I’m driven by making a difference to people’s prosperity, both in developing and developed countries,” said Joe. “I see my specialist area of trade and investment over the past 18 years as a key avenue to this, particularly through sustainable job creation. Moving to DAI provides me with the opportunity to deliver a greater level of sustained impact through long-term projects and to shape delivery from the outset."
