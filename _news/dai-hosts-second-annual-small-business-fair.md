DAI recently hosted its second annual small business fair at DAI headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, where representatives from small development firms met with DAI staff members to establish connections and explore partnerships.

[Mauricio Vera][1], director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at the U.S. Agency for International Development, gave the keynote address and praised DAI for having a "commitment to small business and recognizing the value of small business."

"We will have greater development impact if we continue to have great partners," said [Jim Boomgard][2], DAI's president and chief executive officer. "Gatherings like this help make that happen."

After opening remarks by Vera and DAI Small Business Liaison Officer Kurt Olsson, timed matchmaking sessions were held between DAI's key buyers and more than 20 pre-selected small firms that provide services for global development projects.

Each small business made new connections with up to 10 different DAI departments. The firms represented a wide variety of services, including monitoring and evaluation, information technology procurement, media and communications, mobile applications, environmental services, and training.
