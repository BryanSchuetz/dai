“Corteva Agriscience offers a wealth of technical insight and market knowledge to DAI, and is therefore a natural partner in our work to drive sustainable agricultural development,” said [Jim Winkler](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/jim-packard-winkler), DAI senior trade and investment advisor. 

DAI works in the agriculture sector to increase productivity, strengthen markets, facilitate trade and investment, and raise household incomes to achieve sustainable impact. The firm is currently working on agriculture, agribusiness, and food security programs in developing countries for international donors such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.K. Department for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the European Commission, in addition to agriculture-related projects for commercial clients.

“As a premier global development company, DAI is an ideal partner for Corteva Agriscience in our efforts to scale innovative technologies to smallholder farmers to improve global food security,” said Jennifer Billings, Corteva Agriscience agriculture development leader.

The MOU recognizes the importance of public-private partnerships to strengthen and grow agricultural markets worldwide.

“We look forward to working together on donor-funded projects and additional opportunities of mutual interest to enrich the lives of both producers and consumers,” said Jerry Flint, Corteva Agriscience Global Initiatives and Sustainability Leader.
