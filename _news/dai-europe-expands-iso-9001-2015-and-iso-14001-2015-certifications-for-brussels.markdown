DAI’s Brussels office has earned the right to display the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification marks to demonstrate its conformance to these international standards. At the same time, DAI Europe’s headquarters in Apsley, United Kingdom, achieved recertification in both ISO standards.

ISO 9001:2015 certification requires that a business implements a quality management system that ensures consistency and continuous improvement, leading to high levels of performance and customer satisfaction. Business operational processes—such as project delivery, human resources, project finance, and procurement—undergo ISO scrutiny, as do processes for and documentation of performance evaluation, legal compliance, improvement and adaptation, risk management, and qualifications and preparedness of leadership.

ISO 14001:2015 requires organisations to document and implement policy and action plans that manage environmental impact, including for areas such as compliance, wastage, and environmental proactivity. Organisations certified in ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are committed to continuous improvement and assessed annually to ensure progress is being maintained.

“This certification substantiates the hard work and attention to detail that our staff applies here in the United Kingdom, in Brussels, and around the world, and gives us an additional quality standard,” said Melanie Machray, DAI’s Quality and Systems Coordinator. “We want our customers and colleagues to know about our quality expectations, our focus on client satisfaction, and our commitment to continuous improvement.”
