DAI is pleased to announce that it has achieved the internationally recognized ISO 9001:2015 certification for its operations in Nigeria, confirming the location as an operations leader in international development consulting and implementation.

[ISO 9001:2015 certification](https://www.iso.org/standard/62085.html) requires that a business implements a quality management system that ensures consistency and continuous improvement, leading to high levels of performance and customer satisfaction. Processes subject to ISO scrutiny include project delivery and monitoring, opportunity tracking, expressions of interest, proposal preparation, contract finalization, human resources, travel, and procurement.

“This certification is a statement that we operate to a set framework to achieve our organizational objectives," said Dr. [Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah), DAI's Nigeria Director. "It was obtained by an external certification audit, which proves commitment to our objectives and will increase our credibility and customer confidence in our service.

“I am proud of the remarkable work that has gone into the process of obtaining this accreditation, in a little over a year—it is a clear indicator of the excellence and tenacity of the team. Our focus is on client satisfaction, and by running a quality management system—we stay in control of processes and procedures, which ensures that if anything does go wrong it is rectified quickly, efficiently, and to the satisfaction of the customer."
