DAI Global Health celebrates globally the first annual One Health Day on November 3.

The [USAID Preparedness & Response][1] project, tasked with working with country governments in Asia and Africa to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging disease threats, held a One Health conference in Thailand with government leaders and civil society partners, and worked with the government of Uganda to launch its One Health platform.

"One Health is the proven approach to multisectoral collaboration, and that approach is essential to improving global health security," said [Chris LeGrand][2], DAI Global Health President. "To fight infectious disease threats, you need everyone at the table. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, and Environment, and Finance; government and civil society and the private sector; people working at the national level and the regional and global level. The national One Health platforms we're building bring these people together, and they do it in a sustainable way. The One Health platforms are long-term partners in global health security."
