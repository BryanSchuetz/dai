DAI Is delighted to partner with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on a new program to assist countries in Eurasia and Eastern Europe—including Ukraine, Moldova, and countries across the Western Balkans and the Caucasus—in joining the European Union (EU).

The [Advancing Commerce Connectivity and Exports Leading to Economic Readiness for Accession to the EU (ACCELERATE)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-advancing-commerce-connectivity-and-exports-leading-to-economic-readiness-for-accession-to-the-eu-accelerate) program facilitates EU accession by working with countries to help them meet the economic, governance, and political criteria associated with accession and by addressing common economic constraints to accession on a regional basis. The five-year program will strengthen trade and governance across the region while enhancing the region’s access to U.S. and European markets.

Working across public and private sectors, ACCELERATE will address issues such as trade facilitation, access to finance, compliance with EU standards and obligations, investment transparency, public financial management, and anticorruption.

Chief of Party [Kristi Ragan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kristi-ragan)—an expert in leading large, complex buy-in-based programs for USAID in high-profile, politically sensitive settings—will lead a DAI team comprising experts from across the region and subcontractors that include Policy and Management Consulting Group, Planet Partnerships, Nextrade Group, and Civitta International. 

The consortium’s collective experience providing industry-leading technical support in cross-border trade, access to finance, policy and regulatory reform, investment transparency, and digitalization to advance regional economic integration and EU accession for target countries will support U.S. priorities in the region. 

Our team has a significant presence in Eastern Europe, including offices in eight of the countries where ACCELERATE operates—enabling rapid and seamless implementation of activities throughout the region.

“The positive economic impacts for countries joining the EU are well documented,” says Ragan. “ACCELERATE underscores the U.S. commitment to the prosperity and stability of its European partners at a crucial time for a region facing increasing Russian belligerence and Chinese influence.

“DAI has deep experience in Europe and Eurasia, including hands-on knowledge of EU accession issues. Our scale and geographical presence in both the USAID and EU development markets will be an important asset to leverage for ACCELERATE.  We know how to manage regional buy-in platforms to deliver innovation, efficiency, and tailored solutions that build on continuous learning.”
