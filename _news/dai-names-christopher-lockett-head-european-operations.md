DAI today announced that Christopher Lockett, a 10-year veteran of HTSPE Ltd., has been appointed Managing Director of DAI's Europe office and Senior Vice President of DAI.

"I am honored and delighted to accept this challenging new position," said Lockett. "The capabilities our unified operation brings to the development field—and the opportunities we have for learning across clients, geographies, and disciplines—make this an exciting time to lead DAI's operations in Europe."

Lockett was appointed Managing Director of HTSPE in 2007, in which position he was responsible for all operational aspects of the firm. He started his career with Hewlett-Packard. Having completed his MBA, he joined P-E International—one of HTSPE's predecessor firms—in 1996. He moved to an Interim Management firm in 2002, to set up a public sector practice, before rejoining HTSPE in 2004 as Director of the EU Division. He has worked as a management consultant across the public and private sectors and worked extensively with U.K. Government departments.

"Christopher is a proven leader and manager," said DAI President and CEO [James Boomgard][2], who announced the appointment at staff meetings in the United Kingdom. "At a time when clients all over the world are calling on DAI to drive impact, innovation, and value for money, Christopher's combination of international development and management consulting experience positions him well to craft the creative, competitive solutions that will really make a difference in our marketplace."

DAI [joined forces][3] with Hemel Hempstead-based HTSPE on December 31, 2013, adding to its portfolio more than 100 short- and long-term projects for clients such as the U.K. Department for International Development, EuropeAid, and the World Bank, in technical areas including climate change, land tenure, governance, education, and monitoring & evaluation.
