Our lead story describes how DAI is [utilizing market-driven strategies](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-market-driven-strategies-to-reduce-poverty-and-human-trafficking-in-nigeria/) in Nigeria to address rural poverty and alleviate human slavery. DAI’s Nigeria Country Director, [Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah), reviews the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)-funded [Market Development in the Niger Delta](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-market-development-programme-made) project and looks ahead to its next phase.

In Haiti, the country’s health information system marked a key step forward with the [launch of its national tuberculosis tracker](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/health-system-in-haiti-takes-key-step-by-launching-national-tuberculosis-tracker/). Atwood Raphael, Deputy Chief of Party of the [Haiti Strategic Health Information System Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-strategic-health-information-system-his-program), describes how the tracker will capture, monitor, and report all patient-level TB data across the country, which suffers a high incidence of the contagious disease.
