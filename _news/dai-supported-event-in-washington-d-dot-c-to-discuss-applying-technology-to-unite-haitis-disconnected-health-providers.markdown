Haiti’s digital and paper-based health reporting platforms vary greatly from city to city and village to village, making the country highly vulnerable to health emergencies. On May 3, the Harvard Alumni for Global Development and the Embassy of Haiti will host a discussion on how technology is being applied to link and unite health providers and facilities across Haiti. The event in Washington, D.C., will feature Bobby Jefferson, [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health)’s Chief Technology Officer, and Jeff Mecaskey, DAI's technical lead for economics and financing, evidence, and learning.

![bobby-jefferson-(1).jpg](/uploads/bobby-jefferson-(1).jpg){:.float-left}Jefferson, top left, and Mecaskey, bottom left, will summarize early findings from the [Haiti Strategic Health Information System Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-strategic-health-information-system-his-program) (HIS) as well as findings from related programs. HIS, which launched in June 2017, aims to [consolidate and integrate](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-to-launch-usaid-health-information-system-program-in-haiti) Haiti’s disconnected health information assets under the national System d’Information Sanitaire Nationale Unique (SISNU). By creating a single, comprehensive health information system, Haiti would be better prepared to address the daily needs of its 11 million people and its inevitable health crises, especially considering its challenging history of devastating earthquakes, hurricanes, and contagious disease, including the 2010 cholera outbreak.

“For years, each geographic area or disease-specific initiative in Haiti has come with its own technology—if any—for a health information system,” Mecaskey said. “HIV/AIDS has its own system, as does tuberculosis and maternal and child health. A major obstacle to knowing the big picture and effecting the best planning, policy, and health care arises from these different systems being incompatible and unable to talk with one another.”

![Jeff-Mecaskey-(1).jpg](/uploads/Jeff-Mecaskey-(1).jpg){:.float-left}Mecaskey said this disconnect results in national health planners encumbered in setting national priorities, department managers in assessing where services succeed or not, and facility-level providers in providing good-quality health care in the face of disparate information and guidance.

Jefferson will outline how technology innovation and training can eventually achieve real impact, and how the work being done in Haiti is replicable in other countries. Mecaskey, a graduate of the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, will highlight early evidence from Haiti’s health ministry in its use of SISNU, including the integration of health information across the range of digital and paper-based reporting platforms currently in place. They will also discuss Haiti’s emerging and largely self-sufficient tech sector and the June 21–23 [Haiti Tech Summit](http://haititechsummit.com/).

The knowledge-sharing event will be held from 7–8:30 p.m. May 3 at the Embassy of Haiti. There is limited seating on a first-come registration basis.
