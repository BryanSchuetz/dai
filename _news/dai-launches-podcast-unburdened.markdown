DAI has launched [Unburdened](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-podcast), a podcast that gives DAI’s cut on global health issues, that go beyond healthcare. The podcast aims to discuss large global problems, through a health lens and uses data to highlight the importance of development activities.  

[Kirsten Weeks](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kirsten-weeks), Vice President of Global Health at DAI said, “So much of what we’ve experienced with COVID-19 is how global health affects our entire lives. This podcast is a way to explore how things like equity, pollution, governance, and economics impact our wellbeing—and discover what we can do about it.” 

Unburdened’s first, five-episode series asks the question: Can gender equality make us healthier? and uses the United Nations’ gender inequality index to frame discussions.

The five episodes include: 

[Episode 1](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-1/): Can gender equality make us healthier? Most of us agree that equality is a good thing, but is there more than a moral argument for making our societies more equal?  

[Episode 2](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-2/): Why aren’t men and women equal? If there’s a gap between men and women, how do we know that empirically?  

[Episode 3](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-3/): Can female politicians make us healthier? For a long time, women in politics wasn’t a thing. People like Merkel, Marin, May, Sirleaf, and Arden have given us a vision for women as decision makers. Will more female politicians in positions of power make our societies healthier?   

[Episode 4](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-4/): Can better reproductive health make us more equal? How society treats a woman during pregnancy and childbirth is a signal of women’s status in society. Do we value maternal health as integral to the health of our communities?  

[Episode 5](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-5/): Where do we go from here? What’s next and where do we go from here? As development practitioners and public health professionals, how do we make our work more gender equal?   

Episodes follow a narrative storyline and feature DAI’s own experts as well as academics and experts from outside the company. The show is hosted by Megan Howe, a communications advisor and specialist in DAI’s [Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) unit. Megan has worked in the humanitarian and development field for most of her career, except for taking a short break to work as a journalist. She hopes the podcast will make discussions around global health accessible, jargon-free, and inspiring to health and non-health professionals alike.
