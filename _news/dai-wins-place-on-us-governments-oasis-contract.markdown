The U.S. General Services Administration has awarded DAI a place on the [One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Solutions](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/products-services/professional-services/buy-services/oasis-and-oasis-small-business) (OASIS) contracting vehicle, one of a family of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts that “provide flexible and innovative solutions for complex professional services.”

DAI has been selected as a vendor in the OASIS Unrestricted IDIQ Pool 1: Management Consulting, which is used by agencies across the Federal Government to procure management, scientific, and technical services including engineering, management consulting, environmental, and all other professional services.

OASIS is officially designated a “[Best-in-Class](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/category-management/best-in-class)” (BIC) contracting vehicle by the Office of Management and Budget, which means it is a preferred governmentwide solution that offers pre-vetted, market-proven contract solutions; helps the government optimize its spending; and increases the transaction data available for analyzing federal expenditures.

“We are delighted that our systems, processes and capabilities have met the high standard demanded of OASIS service providers,” said [Tine Knott](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/tine-knott), Senior Vice President for DAI’s U.S. Government Business Unit. “Through this Best-in-Class vehicle, we hope to continue our support to the U.S. Agency for International Development and our traditional partners in the global development sector, while making our services—in environment, finance, digital, and other disciplines—more readily available to other parts of the U.S. Government.”
 
The OASIS IDIQ is active for five years, and task orders can be active through 2029. DAI’s OASIS team is led by Program Manager Natawnee Fritz and Contract Manager Kevin Kelly. For more information, please contact [OASIScontracts@dai.com](mailto:oasiscontracts@dai.com).
