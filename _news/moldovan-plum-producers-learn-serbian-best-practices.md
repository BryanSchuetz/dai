Plum production in Moldova has always been important to the country's economy, pulling in high yields and profits, domestically and internationally.

Following a training event for plum growers implemented by the DAI-led [Agricultural Competitiveness and Enterprise Development (ACED) Project][1]—jointly funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)—many participants requested additional technical assistance and best practices. To assist these prospective and current Moldovan plum growers in their efforts to maximize the marketability of their plums, the ACED team planned a study tour to Serbia for 14 plum producers and two consultants. The western region of Serbia is well known for its plum production and processing.

With support from a consultant from a previous DAI project, [Serbia Agribusiness Project (SAP)][2], the tour was designed to creat an opportunity to showcase modern production and post-harvest practices that can be replicated in Moldova. The participants visited six private companies involved in the production, processing, packing, and exporting of plums and prunes.

"The study program showed us the maximum in theory and practice," said Ludmila Castravet, an individual producer and trader in Moldova.

ACED is a five-year agricultural development project that works to increase the competitiveness of the Moldovan agricultural sector in the production and marketing of crops for domestic and international markets.
