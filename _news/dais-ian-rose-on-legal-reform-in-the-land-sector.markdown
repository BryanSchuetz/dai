One of this year’s themes was how to improve secure access to land for commercial development projects. Rose (third from left in photo) presented on potential [market-oriented legal reforms](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/mozambique-even-a-progressive-land-law-needs-revision-after-a-generation-of-experience/) in the land sector, highlighting proposals to streamline and facilitate transfer of land rights in rural areas. The conference was widely covered in the [Mozambican press](https://uploads/SAVANA%201262.pdf).

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [Supporting the Policy Environment for Economic Development (SPEED\+)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-support-program-economic-and-enterprise-development-speed) project supported the conference. One of the project’s main goals is to support legal reforms in the land sector. Over the course of the first SPEED program, which DAI also led, SPEED [successfully implemented](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/reforming-business-policy-mozambique/) policy reforms, resulting in increased trade and investment, a stronger competitive position for Mozambican firms, and more local job opportunities. SPEED\+ works to further develop a favorable business environment to attract investment, expand markets, and reduce costs, thus contributing to broad-based and inclusive economic growth and conservation of natural resources.

DAI’s Land Tenure and Property Rights practice works across [all types of tenure](http://dai-global-developments.com/developing-alternatives/land-rights/) systems—customary, private, and public—to strengthen the security and rights of land users by focusing on the reforms and capacity building that are appropriate in each context.
