Representatives from nearly 200 countries recently gathered at the COP22 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Morocco and pledged to move forward on the implementation of the [Paris Agreement][1]. More than 50,000 delegates attended multiple events. DAI's [Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF][2]) programme shared a booth with the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency in the Innovation Section at the conference.

Developed by the [Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)][3], in cooperation with French Agency for Development, European Investment Bank, and KfW Development Bank, MorSEFF is a €110 million credit facility dedicated to financing energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy investments of private companies in Morocco, through local participating banks.

Through MorSEFF, prospective borrowers receive dedicated financing, investment incentives of 10 percent or 15 percent of the loan amount (funded by grants from the EU Neighborhood Investment Facility), and free technical assistance for project assessment and implementation by DAI's dedicated implementation team financed by the EU NIF and the SEMED Multi-Donor Fund. MorSEFF has so far issued 50 loans worth €20.4 million, and another 40 are being processed, worth €20.99 million.
