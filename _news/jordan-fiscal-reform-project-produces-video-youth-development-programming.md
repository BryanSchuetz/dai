The program provides Jordanian youth with invaluable professional experience and mentoring that helps them to pursue rewarding and impactful careers in finance and beyond. Alumni of this program have gone on to build careers within FRP, the Government of Jordan, and beyond. FRP offers vital professional experience that helps young people to embark on rewarding, influential careers in the economic and fiscal sectors and to become forces for change in national and regional policy making.

Since 2010, FRP has mentored nearly 40 young people in public finance and budgeting.
