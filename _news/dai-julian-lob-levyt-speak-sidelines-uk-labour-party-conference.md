With the focus shifting from aid commitments to aid impact, the question in the global development community is: how can we maximize our results by utilizing every tool, partner, and technology available?

DAI and its colleagues in the global development industry will tackle [this question][1] and more on the sidelines of the U.K.'s Labour Party Conference in Brighton.

DAI's Senior Vice President, International, Julian Lob-Levyt, will be one of four development industry speakers September 24 at the [fringe event][2].

"Now that various countries are beginning to meet their development obligations, the focus has to shift from the volume of development assistance delivered to the value we're getting out of it," said Dr. Lob-Levyt. "There's a growing role for nontraditional actors and development service providers like DAI in maximizing the impact of aid. The Labour Party is beginning to put together its own thoughts on this issue, so we want to contribute to this policy debate."

Hosted by _The Guardian_, the fringe event will be moderated by Assistant Editor Michael White. Other panelists include MP Ivan Lewis, Shadow Secretary of State for International Development; Director Peter Young of Adam Smith International; Chief Executive Officer Anna Feuchtwang of EveryChild; and Chief Executive Officer Mark Goldring of Oxfam.
