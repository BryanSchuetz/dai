DAI is delighted to introduce the [Spring 2017](http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/spring-2017/) issue of our *Developments* newsletter.

Leading off, Mark Rostal and John Jepsen describe how $1 billion in local financing was [unlocked](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/unlocking-capital-across-kenya-how-usaid-firm-pushed-the-frontier-of-financial-services-and-built-a-foundation-for-economic-growth/) for borrowers throughout Kenya under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Financial Inclusion for Microenterprises project. Rostal and Jepsen further tell how this assistance to hundreds of financial institutions and actors has strengthened the foundation in Kenya for further investment and economic growth.

Next up, Richard Rapier writes of how four diverse countries in Sub-Saharan Africa [significantly increased](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/doubling-access-to-safe-drinking-water-how-four-african-countries-did-it-and-how-others-can-too/) the amount of drinking water available to their citizens. Rapier also prescribes how other water-challenged countries can follow suit.
