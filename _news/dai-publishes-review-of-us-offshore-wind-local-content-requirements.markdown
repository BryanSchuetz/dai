DAI has published a new technical report that reviews the requirements for local content and economic benefit requirements for offshore wind projects constructed in the United States. The report, “U.S. Federal and State Local Content Requirements for Offshore Wind Projects”, analyses both the federal and state level local content requirements and discusses new Jersey as a reference case.

U.S. federal and state agencies are increasingly embedding local content requirements and incentives within the development of large-scale renewable projects. The report unpacks the key policy instruments for leveraging local content in the U.S. offshore wind sector. These include the Inflation Reduction Act, the Jones Act, federal-level wind lease sales, state-level power purchase auctions, and federal- and state-level grants and tax incentives to stimulate the U.S. domestic workforce and supply chain development.

Behind these local content requirements lies the new enthusiasm of governments for policies that leverage domestic industrial transformation and local “green jobs” as outcomes of capital investments in renewable energy projects.

[Zachary Kaplan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/zachary-kaplan), Vice President of [DAI’s Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/sbg) said, “The right policy instruments and incentives in the offshore wind sector could be key in improving domestic energy security, creating local jobs, and achieving net zero.”

“If policy implementation is informed by an understanding of domestic capacity, it can generate local economic prosperity and deliver on green growth.” But he cautioned that “policy ought to strike a careful balance between knowing when to apply stringent local production and procurement rules and when to adopt a more flexible approach or it could risk slowing down the Biden administration’s goal of reaching 30GW of OSW energy by 2030 in exchange for inflexible domestic production requirements.”

The acceleration toward net zero has placed investment in renewables at the forefront of the policy agenda. These investments are considered major opportunities to stimulate sustainable economic growth.

Michael Warner, Senior Advisor to DAI’s Sustainable Business Group and Founder of the Centre for Local Content Innovation said, “To accomplish these economic development goals, governments like that in the U.S. are embedding local content requirements in the development of large-scale renewable development projects. Similar requirements are being used elsewhere in places like the United Kingdom, indicating a global trend toward leveraging local content requirements in renewable energy projects as a new economic policy tool.”

[Tate Crowards](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/tate-crowards), Economist at DAI’s Sustainable Business Group said that: “The local content requirements and incentives being deployed will require time to be implemented, and success will need to be evidenced through comprehensive and continual measurement, evaluation, and learning in both the public and private sectors.”

The report concludes that local content requirements will likely remain integral to federal-level wind leasing and state-level power purchasing and will continue to be increasingly targeted in terms of delivering specified industrial development outcomes with policymakers progressively augmenting regulation with the aim of building domestic supply chains that support, rather than undermine, investment and growth in the U.S. OSW sector.
