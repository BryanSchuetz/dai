DAI is pleased to announce that it has achieved ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certification for its operations in Austria, joining DAI offices in [Belgium and the United Kingdom](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-europe-expands-iso-9001-2015-and-iso-14001-2015-certifications-for-brussels) in holding the internationally recognized quality and environmental management qualifications.

ISO 9001:2015 certification requires that a business implements a quality management system that ensures consistency and continuous improvement, leading to high levels of performance and customer satisfaction. Operational processes—such as business development, project delivery, human resources, and project finance—undergo ISO scrutiny, as do processes for performance evaluation, legal compliance, improvement and adaptation, risk management, and qualifications and preparedness of leadership.

ISO 14001:2015 requires organizations to document and implement policy and action plans that manage environmental impact.
Organizations certified in ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are committed to continuous improvement and assessed annually to ensure ongoing progress and compliance.

“The recertification merged management system audit of May 2022 demonstrated that DAI Global Austria—formally registered as DAI Global Austria GmbH & Co KG—meets the two ISO standards,” said Melanie Machray, DAI’s Quality Systems Manager. “This certification substantiates the hard work and attention to detail our colleagues apply on a daily basis. We want our customers, partners, and all interested parties to know about our quality expectations, focus on client satisfaction, and commitment to continual improvement.”
