DAI is delighted to make its latest [Communication on Progress](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ungc-production/attachments/cop_2020/482447/original/DAI_UNGC_Communication_on_Progress_2019.pdf?1579620304) to the United Nations Global Compact.

The Compact is a “voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles,” with a mission to “mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want.”

Member companies align their strategies and operations with 10 principles covering human rights, labor rights, environmental sustainability, and ethical business practices; and seek to advance social progress as articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DAI joined the Compact in 2018.

“On the threshold of a decade that begins with DAI’s 50th anniversary in 2020 and ends—we hope—with the achievement of the SDGs, we have positioned DAI to provide development services at the confluence of three great resource streams: donor-funded development assistance; direct investments by private enterprises seeking to operate in developing countries; and development finance,” writes DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard in his introduction. “These resource flows have the potential to lift billions of people out of poverty.”

DAI looks forward to advancing the SDGs through almost 200 projects over the next 12 months and to reporting our progress in due course.
