[DAI Capital](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/dai-capital)  offers a multiproduct financial services platform focused on mobilizing and deploying private capital to spur sustainable development in emerging and frontier economies. The DAI Capital platform is based on three pillars: corporate finance, project finance, and asset management. 

Verbeck will drive strategy, marketing, and fundraising for DAI Capital’s impact investing businesses, including for its existing impact asset management platform, [MicroVest](https://microvestfund.com/). 

“I am thrilled to join the dynamic team at DAI Capital,” said Verbeck. “I see great potential for growth in the impact investing market, both in our existing work at DAI Capital and in new areas such as thematically driven impact funds.” 

Based in Colorado, Verbeck is an entrepreneur by instinct and background, having founded and served as CEO for two firms, leading their efforts to scale high-impact programs through alternative financing solutions and strategies. He has launched impact-focused strategies with the recording artist Sarah McLachlan, National Geographic, The Nature Conservancy, Feeding America, and many other partners. Just prior to joining DAI, he completed the design of a private debt strategy for one of the United States’ leading conservation organizations to support indigenous communities. Thematically, his fund strategies have delivered impact in areas such as economic revitalization, land and water conservation, racial and gender equity, and community wealth building.
