An economic growth project in Georgia, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, has been shortlisted for the Emerging Europe Awards 2022 in the category, “Inclusive Entrepreneurship Initiative of the Year.”

Georgia, a small country at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, is situated on a vital trading and transit route for goods and services. In recent years, the country has signed free trade agreements that greatly expand its market access. The DAI-led [USAID Economic Security Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/georgia-usaid-economic-security-program-georgia-esp) builds the competitiveness of key sectors to generate high-value employment, investment opportunities, and increased sales and revenue for companies. The project’s objective is to accelerate Georgia’s transition to an innovation- and knowledge-based economy.

The [Emerging Europe](https://emerging-europe.com/future-of-ee-about/) Awards 2022 nomination cites the project for “unlocking regional economic opportunities for Georgia while supporting the development of enterprises and job creation through smart incentives.” The project is one of three shortlisted in the category.

The USAID Economic Security Program seeks to create at least 4,800 new jobs, support at least 720 small firms, increase sales of assisted enterprises by $60 million, and leverage $18 million in partnerships leveraged through partnerships.
