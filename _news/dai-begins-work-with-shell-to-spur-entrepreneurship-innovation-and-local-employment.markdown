DAI’s Sustainable Business Group has been awarded the [Shell LiveWIRE](https://www.livewire.shell/) Global Consultancy. In this three-year corporate social investment project, DAI will serve as Shell's global advisor on the strategy and implementation of LiveWIRE, its flagship enterprise development program focused on stimulating entrepreneurship, driving innovation, and generating meaningful employment in host countries. 

DAI will help Shell strengthen the program in the 18 countries where LiveWIRE currently operates by developing training programs for early-stage entrepreneurs and identifying opportunities for successful small and medium-sized enterprises to connect with Shell’s local value chain and relevant local markets.

“We are excited and humbled at the prospect of advising the LiveWIRE program,” said Kyle Gunther, who will serve as DAI’s executive director on the Shell LiveWIRE project. “We look forward to building on the thousands of successes LiveWIRE has enabled since its inception in the early 1980s.”
