The Centre’s Accelerate-Her programme targets local women owners, operators, and managers to build their leadership and business skills and help them grow companies across a wide variety of industries and sectors. The programme is designed to accelerate local small business development through tailored workshops, access to one-on-one business advisory and mentors, pitch development, and a supportive peer-learning environment for women. Predicated on successful mentorship and peer-learning models, Accelerate-Her matches a pool of professional mentors with participants based on their professional background and business focus.

The Centre receives financial support from the Greater Guyana Initiative, funded by the Stabroek Block co-venturers ExxonMobil, Hess, and CNOOC.  

“We are excited to launch Accelerate-Her to empower Guyanese women to grow their businesses and leadership as entrepreneurs. Accelerate-Her is part of the Centre for Local Business Development's ongoing efforts to expand the ecosystem of competitive business while generating increased opportunities," said [Centre Director Natasha Gaskin-Peters](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/natasha-gaskin-peters).

The launch of Accelerate-Her expands on the Centre's work in supplier development and local content, to further inclusive and sustainable economic growth through women-led businesses across diverse sectors. Applications have opened for women entrepreneurs seeking to expand their company, access new markets, or increase efficiencies and innovation. Growth-minded businesses in any sector--including tourism, agri-business, food and beverage industry, transport, and hospitality--are encouraged to apply.
