The [Stemazone ](https://stemazoneoman.om/)initiative for Omani youth, funded by Khimji Ramdas Eshraqa and designed and implemented by DAI, was a big winner at this month’s Future Skills and Human Resources Development Conference 2021 in Muscat, Oman. The Arabian Research Bureau ARB/OITE presented awards to Eshraqa—the social development arm of Omani conglomerate Khimji Ramdas—in three categories: “Future Technology,” “Robotics,” and “Best of the Best.”

Stemazone, an innovative educational initiative, focuses on STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) for Omani children aged 6 to 16. Through its [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) and [Center for Digital Acceleration](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration), DAI partnered with Eshraqa to deliver this flagship corporate social responsibility program, which launched in May 2021. In November, the vibrant Stemazone Center at the Children’s Museum in Qurum, Muscat opened its doors. In partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Culture, Sports & Youth, the centre provides an experience zone for in-person workshops and learning.

> “We are delighted that Eshraqa’s Stemazone has received these awards. DAI has helped us to design and implement a world-class education programme that supports Oman’s Vision 2040, equipping youth with skills to take on the challenges of the global economy in the 21st century”,

Stemazone’s virtual learning platform, [e-Stemazone](https://stemazoneoman.om/), is designed to deliver online learning and expand the reach of the programme to students all over Oman. The platform is live in both Arabic and English and offers a library of self-paced learning modules as well as live webinars led by skilled instructors in topics including 3D printing, coding, smart cities and robotics.

“To maximize its reach and overcome some of the challenges of the pandemic, we designed a hybrid delivery model that combines both in-person and virtual training,” said DAI’s [Ahmed Al-Abri](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/ahmed-al-abri). “In collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Innovation, we were able to work with schools from governates around the country to deliver highly impactful virtual workshops.”

“We are so proud of our work with Khimji Ramdas- Eshraqa and delighted to see Stemazone recognized with another three awards. This programme is inspiring thousands of young people to unlock their potential and consider STEAM career opportunities. The curriculum and learning environment keeps students engaged and equip them with skills that will contribute to Oman’s prosperity for generations to come,” said [Chris MacDonald](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/chris-macdonald), Managing Director in DAI’s Sustainable Business Group, with responsibility for Oman and GCC countries.

On 26 October, Oman’s Youth Day, the Stemazone won the Sultanate’s Youth Proficiency Award for Education. The award is presented to the best education initiative.

Leveraging 50 years of economic development experience, DAI has built a growing portfolio of entrepreneurship and innovation programmes over the past 10 years with multilateral, bilateral, foundation, and corporate funders.
