Khalique has worked for DAI since 2011, first as a consultant and since 2012 as Team Leader of the U.K. Department for International Development-funded [AAWAZ Voice and Accountability Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/pakistan-aawaz-voice-and-accountability-programme) to promote civic engagement by marginalized individuals and communities. Among AAWAZ’s accomplishments: more than 300,000 women have been registered as voters and received national ID cards; and more than 227,000 community members have been engaged at the grassroots, district, provincial, and national levels through AAWAZ forums. The program has affected 8 million disadvantaged people directly and another 2 million indirectly through interventions for increasing women’s political participation, conflict pre-emption, and access to public services.

Khalique is a leading poet and author in the Urdu and English languages. He has published eight collections of poetry, one of which received the UBL Literary Excellence Award in 2013, as well as two works of nonfiction, including “Crimson Papers: Reflections on Struggle, Suffering and Creativity in Pakistan,” published by Oxford University Press. He is also a University of Iowa Honorary Fellow in Writing.
