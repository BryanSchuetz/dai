The Spring 2015 issue of DAI's Developments online newsletter is now available.

Leading off, Simone Anzboeck and Inez Couzinet describe how banks in Poland are issuing high-quality loans so small and medium-sized enterprises can invest in [more efficient energy systems][1]. The Poland Sustainable Energy Finance Facility has financed more than 2,000 projects worth a total of â‚¬185 million.

Next up, Jessica Heinzelman describes how SMS messaging on mobile phones is nurturing [mutually profitable relationships][2] between Afghan farmers and wholesalers of farm products. Under this initiative of the Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives for the North, East, and West (IDEA-NEW) program, wholesalers have increased sales of agricultural inputs by 8 to 15 percent while helping farmers protect their crops, boost productivity, and make more money.

In other stories:

* James Naughton shows how a new data-sharing platform is helping Kenya's Hunger Safety Net Programme [keep closer track of assistance][3] to pastoralists and others in drought-prone areas, while improving transparency and accountability.
* Michele Piercey recounts how [social media in Tunisia][4] helped drive increased participation in politics among that country's young people.
* Daniel Ticehurst explains that when monitoring and evaluating the results of land tenure projects in Africa, it is even more important to [monitor and update the assumptions][5] on which the work is based.
* Colleen Green describes the benefits thousands of HIV/AIDS-affected families in impoverished parts of Tanzania have seen by [forming community savings groups][6] to help pay for basics such as school and to get through farming's lean season.
* Finally, Jeson Ingraham [initiates a debate][7] on the challenge of finding both strong executive skills and outstanding technical expertise in our project leaders.
