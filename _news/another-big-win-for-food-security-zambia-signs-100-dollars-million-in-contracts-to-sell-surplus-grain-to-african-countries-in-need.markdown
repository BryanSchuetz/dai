On June 28, Zambia signed $100 million worth of trade contracts with buyers from East and Southern Africa to export grains to countries suffering from a drought affecting more than 40 million people. The contracts—to sell more than 380,000 tons of white maize, soybeans, and other grains—are projected to provide food for 1.78 million families for six months. For Zambia, which is expecting to have a staple food surplus of 3.2 million tons this year, the cross-border sales represent an unparalleled contribution to the food security of East Africa, taking the lead in a powerful story of African sustainability.

The trade contracts were signed in Lusaka at an African regional trade forum facilitated by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s [East Africa](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/east-africa-trade-and-investment-hub-tih) and [Southern Africa](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southern-africa-trade-hub-sath) Trade and Investment Hubs, implemented by DAI.

This marks the second forum of its kind hosted by USAID-funded programs, which seek to facilitate the trade of food grains from countries of surplus to those in deficit. In March, the East Africa Trade and Investment Hub (EATIH) convened the first Trade Facilitation Forum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which [produced $83 million in contracts](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/83-million-grain-deal-between-east-african-countries-demonstrates-how-east-africa-can-feed-itself/?utm_source=daidotcom) that are now supplying grains grown by Ethiopian farmers to buyers in six countries, most notably Kenya. EATIH's regional grain trade initiative is designed to facilitate the efficient flow of staple foods from surplus countries to countries in need.

This latest example of interregional cooperation is an encouraging sign of improving African sustainability and independence. Increased cross-border grain trade will stabilize grain supply and prices in the region, improve food security, and reduce malnutrition. It also allows the region to be less dependent upon emergency food assistance.

To enable the trade transactions, the Zambian government lifted a temporary ban on exports as well as a 10 percent export tax at the behest of the local grain industry. Thanks to the removal of these trade obstacles, Zambia will now be able to profit off of its grain surplus, injecting millions of dollars’ worth of foreign transactions into the Zambian economy and saving lives in the process.
 
“This is the beginning of a long journey that will see a total change in trade relations between Zambia and East Africa,” said Gerald Masila, Executive Director of the Eastern Africa Grain Council (EAGC), as [reported](https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/zamace-will-boost-zambia-east-africa-trade-relations/) in the *Zambia Daily Mail*. “We are glad that [Minister of Finance Felix Mutati] confirmed that the export bans are a thing of the past and that Zambia has changed orientation so that this country will be looking at the agriculture [sector] and agricultural produce as an export opportunity.”

The forum convened 195 sellers and buyers from Burundi, Malawi, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The USAID teams worked with the EAGC in collaboration with Zambia Commodity Exchange to organize the event.
 
“Our role was to devise innovative ways to address complex food security issues through trade mechanisms; in other words, ‘priming the trade pump’ through cost-effective interventions,” said [Juan Estrada](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/juan-estrada-valle), EATIH Chief of Party. “We expect that once the relationships between East African and Zambian traders are solidified and the logistics are worked out, trade between East and Southern Africa will become the norm rather than the exception.

“Intra- and inter-regional trade supports food security,” Estrada added. “This has positive and concomitant effects on health and nutrition, while supporting social stability, reducing irregular migration, and promoting global security.”
