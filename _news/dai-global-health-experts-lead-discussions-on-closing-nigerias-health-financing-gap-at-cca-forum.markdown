McIntyre-Brown, Health Practice Director for DAI Global Health, presented an analysis of the health sector investment environment and identified areas for investment and innovation, including private franchising of primary health care facilities. Noted Dr. Ogbe Oritsewegimi, Head of Health Financing for Nigeria’s National Primary Health Care Development Agency: “The private sector is driven by the bottom line, but in health there has to be two bottom lines—one for profit and one for the community.”

Baldridge, co-author of “[Gathering the Evidence to Mobilize Domestic Resources for Health Care](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/marshaling-the-evidence-to-better-help-developing-countries-improve-and-afford-their-health-services/),” and McIntyre-Brown also led roundtable discussions for attendees including government, business, and health industry leaders.
