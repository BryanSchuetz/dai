DAI is delighted to submit its [2021 Communication on Progress](https://dai-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ungc-final-2021.pdf) to the United Nations Global Compact.

The [Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/) is a “voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles,” with a mission to “mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want.”

Member firms align strategies and operations with 10 principles covering human rights, labor rights, environmental sustainability, and ethical business practices, and seek to advance social progress as articulated in the [17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). DAI [joined the Compact](https://www.dai.com/our-work/our-impact) in 2018.

“In 2021, the environment—climate in particular—has been a point of emphasis for DAI,” writes DAI President and CEO [Jim Boomgard](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/board/james-boomgard) in his introduction to the publication. “Last year, I ended my Statement of Support by noting that ‘responsible companies must increasingly turn their attention to a pervasive threat that will remain the world’s biggest challenge long after COVID-19 has become a manageable disease: that threat is climate change.’ This year, we have invested significantly in our already robust climate capabilities.”

While addressing the broad range of the SDGs, our 2021 Communication on Progress focuses particularly on some of DAI’s [extensive work](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/climate) in climate change adaptation and mitigation. We look forward to continuing our support for climate action and to advancing the SDGs through more than 200 projects over the next 12 months.
