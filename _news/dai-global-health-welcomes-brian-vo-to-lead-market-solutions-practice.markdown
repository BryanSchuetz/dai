DAI is delighted to announce the appointment of [Brian Vo](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/brian-vo) to lead the Market Solutions practice in its Global Health Business. The Market Solutions practice focuses on integrating market-based tools and approaches into our technical designs, re-imagining partnerships with the private sector and social enterprises to generate new health solutions, and deploying investment skills and capital to achieve health outcomes.

Brian was most recently Vice President of Social Investment and Innovative Finance at Pact, where he led Pact Ventures and Pact Institute in developing corporate and foundation partnerships to magnify social impact by testing new delivery models that integrate market-based mechanisms.

“I’m thrilled to be joining the global DAI team,” said Brian, who will be based in Washington, D.C. “It’s clear that markets are key to scaling delivery and care outcomes; public and donor funding can only reach so far. By leveraging innovative finance, market-based mechanisms, and high-impact social enterprises we can activate the private sector to help us scale health solutions that work. Building on DAI’s long history and commitment to engaging the private sector—through its [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business), [DAI Capital](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/dai-capital), and other teams—our Market Solutions practice will serve as the connective tissue to better leverage DAI’s broader capabilities in the health arena.”

Before his work at Pact, Brian was a director at Quantified Ventures, an impact investing and social enterprise advisory firm; and a consultant in the Public & Social Sector and Strategy & Corporate Finance Practices at McKinsey & Company, where he advised clients on economic development, growth strategies, capital allocation, operational turnarounds, and transaction structuring. He began his career with Jefferies & Company Investment Bank and Macquarie’s Private Equity Group based in New York.

“Brian is passionate about health and development, and he marries that passion to a wealth of tools, experience, and expertise from the world of commercial finance and social investment,” said [Jenny Baker](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/jenny-baker), Senior Vice President, [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health). “Brian has the vision and the know-how to help us use market solutions—in particular financial solutions—to strengthen health systems, expand access to high-quality care, and get ever closer to universal health coverage.”

Brian holds MBA and bachelor’s degrees from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
