Elizabeth Sullivan, a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist on DAI's [Trans-Sahara Security Symposium][1] (TSS) project, was named by the _Diplomatic Courier_ magazine and the Young Professionals in Foreign Policy (YPFP) association as one of the top 99 leaders under the age of 33 working in international affairs.

The magazine created the award to "capture the extraordinary impact of the millennial generation on international affairs."

Sullivan's work on TSS focuses on evaluating efforts to increase North and West African civil-military capacity to counter irregular threats. Prior to DAI, she worked at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on issues of U.S.-Africa foreign policy and directed an initiative, the Next America Project, which built a bipartisan network of young professionals to shape a millennial vision for America's global future.

Sullivan has evaluated peacebuilding and economic recovery efforts in Indonesia with Mercy Corps, cofacilitated conflict resolution workshops with a local nongovernmental organization in Ghana, and supported U.S. foreign policy efforts with the U.S. Embassy in Zambia. She has also spent time working in Burkina Faso, Chad, Dominican Republic, Mali, Mauritania, and Nigeria. Sullivan studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and graduated magna cum laude from the University of California Santa Barbara.

The awards were given to the ["99Under33"][3] after Diplomatic Courier and YPFP accepted nominations and formed a selection committee to determine who would be on the list. Leaders from the business, government, and academic sectors nominated several hundred individuals and selections were made through a three-step committee process.
