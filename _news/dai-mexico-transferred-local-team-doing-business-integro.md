DAI is delighted to announce the sale of its Mexico City-based regional consulting practice, DAI Mexico, to the outstanding team of local managers and technical specialists who have run the operation since it was started in 2009.

Their new, independent company—[INTEGRO][1]—will continue to offer world-class consulting services focused on the financial services and enterprise development sector in Mexico and the region.

"The launch of a locally owned, locally run, woman-led company is a gratifying outcome to six years of investment and sustained capacity building," said DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard. "We look forward to many years of continued engagement with INTEGRO, which will remain a valued local partner for DAI in our ongoing international donor-based project work in Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean."

Led by Managing Director and long-time DAI employee Claudette Martínez, INTEGRO is owned by a small team of technical and managerial staff committed to building on a six-year legacy of responsive, client-centered technical assistance.

"This is an exciting time for all of us at INTEGRO," said Martínez. "Our clients are looking for compelling innovation tailored to local needs, and we are well placed to deliver for them."

While focusing initially on its core strengths in financial services and enterprise development—as reflected in current assignments such as an agricultural credit program with four cooperatives funded by Mexican rural development bank FIRA—INTEGRO plans over time to expand into adjacent technical areas and markets.
