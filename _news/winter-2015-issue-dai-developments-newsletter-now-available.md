The Winter 2015 issue of DAI's *Developments* newsletter is now available.

Leading off, Vanna Kruy describes how he developed an application—now with 300,000 downloads and counting—that enables Cambodians to [use smartphones more easily][1] using their native Khmer alphabet. Kruy took advantage of the resources provided at the 5D Lab, a community space opened in Phnom Penh by the U.S. Agency for International Development's [Development Innovations][2] program.

Next up, Mark Rasmuson writes about an initiative in Danang, Vietnam, that [enables][3] more than 1,000 disabled children to attend schools where teachers and classrooms are now better equipped to meet their special needs.

In other articles:

* James Naughton describes the method used in Somalia to [collect the reliable data][4] needed to design economic growth activities for a U.K. Department for International Development program.
* Isaac Masingati tells of how thousands of Malawians are [establishing backyard gardens][5] of indigenous vegetables, helping families to enjoy healthier eating.
* John Jepsen interviews Brigit Helms about the [future of mobile money][6] and its relationship to users, businesses, and traditional banks.
* Victoria Bullock shares results and best practices from a program that [nurtured a culture of law and justice][7] in four major cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
