DAI Europe has achieved the internationally recognised ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 standards, establishing it as an operations leader in international development consulting and implementation.

The independent assessment was conducted by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)-affiliated British Assessment Bureau and substantiates DAI Europe's commitment to customer service and quality in delivery. As a result, DAI Europe has earned the right to display the coveted British Assessment Bureau ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification marks to demonstrate its conformance to the standards.

ISO 9001:2015 certification requires that DAI Europe delivers on business commitments and has a quality management system in place that ensures consistency and continuous improvement, leading to high levels of performance and customer satisfaction. Processes that underwent ISO scrutiny include project delivery and monitoring, project finance and administration, opportunity tracking, expressions of interest, proposal preparation, contract finalization, human resources, and travel and procurement.

ISO 14001:2015 requires organisations to have an environmental policy and action plan to manage their impact on the environment, including in areas such as compliance, wastage, and environmental proactivity. Organisations certified in ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are committed to continuous improvement and assessed annually to ensure progress is being maintained.

"When HTSPE joined with DAI at the end of 2013, we needed to define and revise our business processes," said Melanie Machray, DAI Europe's Quality and Systems Coordinator. "We knew the 2015 standard was going to be released and would be revised to address the change in today's business world, with a drive toward a process and risk-based approach.

"The new 2015 standard also allowed merging with the environmentally focused ISO 14001 and we wanted to be one of the first U.K. companies to deploy a merged management system in accordance with the new standard.

"This certification substantiates the hard work and attention to detail that our staff applies here in the United Kingdom and around the world, and gives us an additional quality standard. We also want our customers and colleagues to know about our quality expectations, our focus on client satisfaction, and our commitment to continuous improvement."
