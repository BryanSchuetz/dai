The COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly challenging developing countries, particularly the least developed, as per a recent estimate from UNDP that sees their income loss exceeding $220 billion.

As a global company implementing development aid in challenging environments and a long-term presence in more than 100 countries, we are leveraging our in-house expertise and multiclient experience to create synergies, share knowledge, and identify innovative solutions to the global COVID-19 crisis. DAI’s teams around the world are in close communication with donors and partner countries stakeholders to coordinate an effective response to the pandemic. In-house technical staff are developing toolkits, including organisation-wide response strategies, project/context/sectoral approaches to adaptation, as well as developing digital approaches and solutions.

As a leading think-and-do tank on sustainable development policies and practices, the [European Centre for Development Policy Management](https://ecdpm.org/) (ECDPM) has mobilised its expertise and key network, from policy makers and knowledge institutions, to business associations and development financiers, in an effort to reflect on how best to address the [challenges of the pandemic](https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/covid-19-international-cooperation/), and how this may affect EU-Africa relations, and development and international cooperation more broadly. 

## Practical Webinars 

One of the outcomes of this global effort is to share this knowledge and engage with our partners and clients in online discussions targeting a European and international audience of global development stakeholders, through practical webinars addressing their main priorities. 

DAI-ECDPM webinars bring together public and private practitioners to reflect on the immediate reaction of the development community and support the post-pandemic global response of the European Union, as per its recent [Communication](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/system/files/joint-comm-2020-eu-global-response_en.pdf). 

The webinars, using Webex, will be recorded and remain available on DAI’s and ECDPM’s websites.

The crisis has revealed their vulnerability to the supply and demand side, and as per a recent OECD paper, there is a serious risk that more than 50 percent of them will not survive the next few months. 

In low-income countries, formal and informal MSMEs are significant engines of growth, employment, innovation, and social development.

**Date:** Monday, June 22, 9 am–10:15am, Eastern Daylight Time; 3pm–4:15pm Central European Summer Time

How can the EU best support countries that sometimes still lack the necessary infrastructure and equipment to deploy e-solutions, or where people’s livelihood rely on informal day-by-day income generating activities?
