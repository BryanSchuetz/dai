The COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly challenging developing countries, particularly the least developed, as per a recent estimate from UNDP that sees their income loss exceeding $220 billion.

As a global company implementing development aid in challenging environments and a long-term presence in more than 100 countries, DAI is currently leveraging its in-house expertise and multiclient experience to create synergies, share knowledge and identify innovative solutions to the global covid-19 crisis. DAI’s teams around the world are in close communication with donors and partner countries stakeholders to coordinate an effective response to the pandemic. In-house technical staff are developing toolkits, including organisation-wide response strategies, project/context/sectoral approaches to adaptation, as well as developing digital approaches and solutions.

As a leading think-and-do tank on sustainable development policies and practices, the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) has mobilised its expertise and key network, from policy-makers, knowledge institutions to business associations and development financiers, in an effort to reflect on how best to address the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, and how this may affect EU-Africa relations, and development and international cooperation more broadly. 

## Practical Webinars 

One of the outcomes of this global effort is to share this knowledge and engage with our partners and clients in online discussions targeting a European and international audience of global development stakeholders, through practical webinars addressing their main priorities. 

DAI-ECDPM webinars bring together public and private practitioners to reflect on the immediate reaction of the development community and support the post-pandemic global response of the European Union, as per its recent Communication. 

Four webinar sessions of 75 minutes will be organised in June 2020. Depending on the interest in the webinar sessions and evolution of the COVID-19 situation, the series might be expanded. 

DAI and ECDPM will invite a balanced range of speakers and target relevant audiences, promoting the webinars through their online channels (newsletters, social media, websites…).

The webinars, using Webex, will be recorded and remain available on DAI’s and ECDPM’s websites.
