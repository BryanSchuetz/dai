The Foundation for Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND) recently received a 2012 Delta Achievers' Merit Award (NDAMA) for its work on partnerships that promote inclusive economic growth.

The awards go to organizations that have contributed to the advancement of the Niger Delta region organizations—"that may have never been commended or recognized by government and society for their remarkable performance in the growth and development of the Niger Delta region."

[PIND][2], an independent foundation launched two years ago with funding from Chevron, won the NDAMA through a public voting system. The foundation's mission is to "establish and encourage innovative multistakeholder partnerships that support programs and activities which empower communities to achieve a peaceful and enabling environment for equitable economic growth in the Niger Delta."

DAI has been [working with PIND][3] since late 2010 to develop its economic development program: assisting with overall strategy development, providing regional economic analysis and building analytical capacity within the PIND team, guiding it through value chain studies, and helping the PIND staff to design and implement their program activities. PIND's economic development program takes a systemic approach to inclusive economic development, combining the value chain and making markets work for the poor (M4P) methods.
