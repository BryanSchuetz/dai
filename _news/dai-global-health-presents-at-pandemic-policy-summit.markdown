Two [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) experts will present next week at the [4th Annual Pandemic Policy Summit](http://bush.tamu.edu/2018-pandemic/), at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center at Texas A&M University. The summit is focused on the importance of One Health—the nexus of human, animal, and environmental sciences—100 years on from the 1918 influenza outbreak that swept the globe, with the theme, “Looking back to look forward: Are we prepared for the next pandemic?”

The summit, organized by the [Snowcroft Institute of International Affairs](http://bush.tamu.edu/scowcroft/), is held to engage government officials, donors, the private sector, academic and research organizations, implementing partners and bilateral and multilateral leaders in simulation and discussion to prompt decision-making and inspire leadership in approaches to global health security and management and response to the emergence of pandemic diseases.

DAI’s [Susan Scribner](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/susan-scribner), Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s global [Preparedness & Response (P&R)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr) project, will present a keynote speech on October 15, during a Chatham House-style session titled, “Building more effective mechanisms for multisector collaboration/coordination,” and will also be on a One Health panel with [Jay Maddock](https://sph.tamhsc.edu/dean/biography.html), Dean of Public Health at Texas A&M University; [Christine Kreuder Johnson](https://www2.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty2/results.cfm?fid=17867) of the University of California at Davis; [Kristian G. Andersen](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/andersen/) of the Scripps Research Institute; and Dr. [Lei Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhou-lei-a00ab2a5/) from the Chinese Center For Disease Control And Prevention.

[Robert Salerno](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/robert-salerno), DAI Global Health’s Technical Integration Manager for P&R, will present a Sponsor Innovation segment during the public stage of the conference, the Pandemic Response Innovation Forum, on October 16, discussing the One Health Assessment for Planning and Performance (OH-APP), a monitoring framework for multisectoral coordination mechanisms to annually self-assess their organizational capacity and performance. The OH-APP complements the WHO Joint External Evaluation, providing more specific indicators to measure the maturity of a multisectoral coordination mechanism and to benchmark its progress towards becoming a sustainable mechanism for preparedness and response to public health threats.
