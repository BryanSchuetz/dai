DAI Global Health is hosting a plenary panel session—"​Embedding social innovation: expanding and adapting community empowerment models to drive gender equality"—at the Triangle Global Health Consortium Annual Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, on September 27.

The session will be moderated by WISE Development’s Technical Director, [Georgia Taylor](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/georgia-taylor), who specializes in women’s economic empowerment, tackling violence against women and girls, improving women’s access to maternal, newborn and child health, and sexual and reproductive health.

Georgia will be joined by: [Dr. Fatima Adamu](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/fatima-adamu), DAI’s Technical Lead for the [Women for Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-women-for-health-w4h) programme in Nigeria; Dr. Mary Nambao, a public health specialist who previously worked as Deputy Director for mother health in the Zambian Ministry of Health and is currently a Child Health and Immunisation Advisor with JSI; [Joanna Drazdzewska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-drazdzewska-74999b6a/?originalSubdomain=np), a Grant Manager with Women and Children First, specializing in participatory learning and action; and [Molly Rosett](https://www.intrahealth.org/people/molly-rosett), a Program Officer supporting IntraHealth International's West Africa regional portfolio.

Aligned with this year’s conference theme Looking Toward the Future: Innovation for Global Health Impact, the DAI Global Health panel focuses on Embedding social innovation: expanding and adapting community empowerment models to drive gender equality. Panellists will share innovations from four contexts where social change is embedded in the community, and explore how the community empowerment, governance, accountability and capacity building dynamics of these social innovations result in better health outcomes for women and children.

The panel will explore different perspectives on achieving much greater health impact by grounding interventions in the social realities faced by women in challenging contexts. It will consider approaches that go far beyond traditional training programmes and tackle women’s lack of agency at the community level for sustainable and scalable impact. Whilst the social innovations presented all share the common theme of empowerment of women, each context has resulted in a variety of community-embedded implementation models which have the potential to deliver significantly greater positive health outcomes.

The Triangle Global Health Consortium is a non-profit member organisation representing institutions and individuals from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, the international health development NGO community, and academia. The Consortium’s vision is ‘Innovation through collaboration to improve the health of the world’s communities’, and the 2018 Annual Conference will bring together global health leaders to consider the ways that we can utilise innovative ideas to create positive impact on the communities in which we work.
