The new, five-year, $15 million [Feed the Future Senegal Policy Systems Services](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/senegal-feed-the-future-policy-systems-services-pss-activity), administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), aims to strengthen Senegal’s agricultural and food policy systems by working with the Government of Senegal, the Senegalese private sector, and civil society to create an enabling environment that contributes to accelerated and inclusive growth. Reforms will support the [Plan Senegal Emergent](https://www.sec.gouv.sn/dossiers/plan-s%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal-emergent-pse) (PSE), with broad stakeholder consensus on the priorities and mutual accountability for commitments to action in support of national plans.

The Activity will be implemented by a consortium led by DAI together with IPAR, a Senegalese policy think tank. It will engage nongovernmental organizations, consulting firms, and research institutions to deliver training, provide policy analysis support, and strengthen institutional capacity on a demand-driven basis, in response to activity needs identified during implementation.

Feed the Future Senegal Policy Systems Services’ interventions will be implemented through two components:

* Enhancing Government of Senegal policy processes by working with government stakeholders to identify needs for evidenced-based decision-making. 
* Enhancing the capacity of private sector and civil society to influence policy formulation, implementation, and impact by providing organizational strengthening to key private sector and civil society institutions—especially farmer organization platforms as well as value chain-based professional associations. 

Key facets of Feed the Future Senegal Policy Systems Services’ support to the policy and reform implementation will include fostering dialogue with the Government of Senegal by linking private sector and civil society stakeholders to critical high-level policy forums and strengthening stakeholder engagement in the implementation of selected projects in the second phase of the PSE’s Adjusted and Accelerated Priority Action Plan.
