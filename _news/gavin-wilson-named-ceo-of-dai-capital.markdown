## DAI deepens its commitment to mobilizing private capital at scale in emerging and frontier economies

Gavin Wilson has been appointed to serve as the first Chief Executive Officer of DAI Capital, the investment banking and asset management arm of DAI.

“As development professionals, we are increasingly attuned to the critical importance of capital flows that spur growth, create jobs, reduce poverty, and support the tax revenues underlying essential public services,” said DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard. “Gavin’s experience in public and private finance, his insights, his know-how, his networks, and his stature in the field will all be invaluable as we build DAI Capital into a driver of sustainable investment in the places that need it most.”

DAI Capital pursues its sustainable investment objectives across two pillars: corporate finance and M&A advisory, and asset management. On the capital advisory side, DAI concluded a majority investment in Magister Advisors in 2020 to form DAI Magister, which directly connects businesses in emerging and frontier markets with global equity investors. On the asset management side, DAI last year acquired MicroVest Capital Management, a leading private credit investor in responsible finance institutions, which has disbursed more than US$1 billion in investments to promote financial inclusion across 60 countries.

“DAI Capital plays an important role in fulfilling DAI’s mission to shape a more livable world,” said Wilson. “We aim to deepen and broaden our product offering, geographic presence, and client relationships to scale up our mobilization of private capital to emerging and frontier markets. The funding shortfall for the Sustainable Development Goals is immense, but not insuperable if we can engage the still relatively untapped resources of global financial markets. Our mandate is to connect those resources with investment opportunity and development need in a way that is profitable, impactful, and sustainable.”

Wilson brings to DAI a wealth of experience at the very highest levels of the development finance, emerging markets, and investing arenas, with a distinguished record of service that spans public and private sectors. 

He spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs, including serving as a Managing Director in the firm’s Investment Banking Division in London. On either side of his time at Goldman, he worked for 16 years at the World Bank Group, including as the founding CEO of IFC Asset Management Company from 2009 to 2017.

The Asset Management Company was an International Finance Corporation subsidiary that established a new business model for multilateral development finance, mobilizing and managing commercial capital to meet development needs. Under his leadership, the company’s 13 funds raised more than $10 billion and executed more than 100 investments in companies and funds covering 69 emerging and frontier markets. 

Wilson served as a Commissioner on the Business and Sustainable Development Commission and co-chaired the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Sustainable Development.
