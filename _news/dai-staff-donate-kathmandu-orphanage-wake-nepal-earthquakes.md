In the aftermath of Nepal's recent earthquakes, DAI staff have raised £1,000 to support a Kathmandu orphanage home to 12 children.

The fundraising effort was led by London-based project manager Cari Wood, whose family has supported the Grace Home Orphanage since 2000.

"Thankfully, the kids and staff are safe from the disaster, including the second earthquake [May 12]," said Cari. "But they're in need of basic resources, as power has been cut and many of their homes have been destroyed or damaged. As one of them described in a message to me, they are 'staying under the open sky'."

The orphanage was founded in October 2000 by D.R. Thulung, a former sherpa who now works as a local tour guide in addition to his responsibilities at Grace Home. A few years later he also set up Grace School, where teachers volunteer their time to give less fortunate children access to a basic education.

"The money you have donated will be in D.R.'s hands to use for the children," wrote Cari in a note to staff, "to assure they have shelter and the basic needs as the country rebuilds its infrastructure."
