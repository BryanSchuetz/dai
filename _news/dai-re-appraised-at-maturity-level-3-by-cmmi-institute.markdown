DAI is delighted to announce that an internal unit has been appraised again at [CMMI Maturity Level 3](https://cmmiinstitute.com/learning/appraisals/levels), after achieving the [same appraisal in 2019](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-appraised-at-cmmi-maturity-level-3). 

Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a capability improvement framework that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes that ultimately improve their performance. 

The CMMI Institute appraised DAI’s internal unit, Stabilization and Transition, at CMMI Level 3 for Services. An organization appraised at Maturity Level 3 is performing at a level where processes are well characterized and understood and are described in defined standards, procedures, tools, and methods.

“We are extremely proud of this accomplishment,” said DAI’s Natawnee Fritz, who served as the internal champion for this effort. “Continued earning of a Maturity Level 3 rating demonstrates and reinforces how we are dedicated to continuous improvement and take a proactive approach to developing and delivering capabilities that produce great results for our customers.” 

The [CMMI Institute](https://cmmiinstitute.com/) “enables organizations to elevate and benchmark performance across a range of critical business capabilities, including product development, service excellence, workforce management, data management, supplier management, and cybersecurity.”
