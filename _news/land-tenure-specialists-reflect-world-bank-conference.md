With a special focus on governance, the conference had one of its highest attendance rates with representatives from governments, civil society, academia, the development community, and the private sector. A few themes rose to the topâ€”including women's rights, community empowerment, and [donor coordination efforts][1], including the [Voluntary Guidelines][2].

DAI's own land tenure specialist Steven Lawry [presented a systematic review][3] he and colleagues performed for the U.K. Department for International Development to analyze quantitative literature on the effects of tenure formalization in developing countries. The review confirmed that while formal registration of individual land rights increases investment, productivity, and household consumption, Africa lagged behind Asia and Latin America for various reasons.

Two colleagues from HTSPE, a [member][4] of the DAI group, presented on successful land tenure projects in [Rwanda][5] and Mozambique.
