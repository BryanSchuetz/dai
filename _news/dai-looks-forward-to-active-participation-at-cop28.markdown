> “We are delighted to have strong representation at COP28 by our experts and projects, who reflect DAI’s leadership in equitable climate finance, clean energy, and transparent climate governance at local and national levels,” said [Jette Findsen](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/jette-findsen), DAI Vice President, Environment.

The following projects and personnel will be present:

* The [European Union (EU) Global Support Facility for Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-eu-global-support-facility-for-nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs) provides technical assistance and policy advice to support the design, update, and implementation of EU partner countries’ NDCs, long-term strategies, and national adaptation plans. The project will support European Commission staff during various COP sessions, acting as facilitators or moderators as required. 

* The DAI-led [Support the Secretariat of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/support-the-secretariat-of-the-global-covenant-of-mayors-for-climate-and-energy) project facilitates coordination mechanisms between the regional and the global covenants. Our technical assistance supports implementation of the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Regional and national covenants serve as local chapters of the broader Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy alliance. Our team, including [Nadya Boneva](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/nadya-boneva), Head of DAI’s EU Climate Practice, will represent COM-MED (the Mediterranean Chapter of GCoM) and speak at the session on “[Climate-neutral cities: A journey to reach zero emission](https://www.cop28eusideevents.eu/e/programme?session=1837504&i=aOtfo30Eo44OQY5XuW0973mHlIxDPisV)” on December 11 (live-streamed).

* The EU [Acting for Climate in South Mediterranean (Clima-Med)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-eu-for-climate-action-in-the-european-neighbourhood-instrument-eni-southern-neighbourhood) project works to enhance partner countries’ energy security and adaptive capacity, leading to more stable, efficient, competitive, and climate-resilient societies and economies while increasing energy sovereignty and reducing emissions. Clima-Med works in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. Clima-Med will be joining forces with GCoM at the “[Climate-neutral cities: A journey to reach zero emission](https://www.cop28eusideevents.eu/e/programme?session=1837504&i=aOtfo30Eo44OQY5XuW0973mHlIxDPisV)” on December 11.

This EU-funded program strengthens resilience to disasters caused by natural hazards and extreme events in countries represented by the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) through support to the OACPS Secretariat. A focus of the program is developing and sharing knowledge on disaster risk reduction by providing a knowledge management system, e-learning, and training. Program Team Leader Dr. Pendo Maro and Cristelle Pratt, OACPS Assistant Secretary General for Environment Climate Action, are speaking on Fostering Climate Adaptation and Resilience in Small Island States on December 1 in the Commonwealth Pavilion.
