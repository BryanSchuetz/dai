DAI is delighted to announce it has joined [2X Global](https://www.2xglobal.org/), a membership organization working to unlock gender-smart capital at scale. 

“Gender-lens investing has become such an important part of DAI’s core work,” said DAI’s Vice President of Economic Growth, [Colleen Green](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/colleen-green). “From our initiatives under the [Feed the Future USAID Market Systems and Partnerships](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-market-systems-and-partnerships-msp) activity to support the care economy to our provision of blended finance to build warehousing and track record facilities for emerging female fund managers under the [USAID Southern Africa Mobilizing Investment](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southern-africa-mobilizing-investment) project, we believe there is much to be gained from focusing on female leadership in the private capital space and the financing of gender-focused businesses.” 

“Joining 2X allows DAI to convene with an exceptional group of changemakers, collaborate with and learn from others, and share our growing body of learning with the market to enable more female founders and business owners, investors, and capital allocators to grow and finance developmentally important endeavors.”

DAI integrates gender programming across all its services: design, research, monitoring and evaluation, assessments, and implementation, as well as through our staffing of projects. We draw on tool kits, research, and theory informed by 50 years of field experience and reflection on what works, what does not, and why. Innovative where appropriate and results-driven in every case, our holistic approach founded on culturally sensitive techniques facilitates positive change for women and men.

“We’re excited to welcome DAI to our community of members at 2X Global,” said 2X Global CEO Jessica Espinoza. “DAI’s global reach and expertise will help to advance our collective mission to unlock gender-smart capital at scale. We envision lots of opportunities for connection, collaboration, and peer learning and we’re thrilled that they have joined us on our journey.”

The in-house technical experts contributing to DAI’s gender-integrated approach include advisors in microfinance financial services and investment, financial inclusion, private sector development, agriculture, climate and environment, trade, health, livelihoods, ICT, stability, and justice reform. DAI’s Gender Equity and Social Inclusion (GESI) Community of Practice builds DAI capacity and awareness around GESI issues, bringing together our latest thinking to develop crosscutting solutions that integrate these sectoral perspectives.
