IntraHealth International and DAI today announced a strategic affiliation that will enable the two organizations to extend their reach and amplify their collective impact in the global health arena.

IntraHealth’s Board of Directors voted unanimously September 11 to approve the legal affiliation.

> “I am delighted to align our team formally with DAI,” **said Pape Amadou Gaye, IntraHealth’s President and CEO.** “DAI has a distinguished history in international development and an unwavering commitment to its development mission. Working together—taking advantage of DAI’s scale and multisectoral reach—we will be better positioned to pursue our shared vision of a healthier, more livable world.”

As an affiliate of DAI, IntraHealth will retain its name and distinct identity, its nonprofit status, and its guiding mission to improve the performance of health workers and strengthen the systems in which they work. IntraHealth has particular expertise in HIV/AIDS, reproductive health and family planning, maternal and child health services, and digital health innovation.
