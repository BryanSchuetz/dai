DAI and THINKMD today announced a strategic partnership that will use DAI’s extensive international network to bring [THINKMD](http://www.thinkmd.org/)’s digital health products to new markets. As part of this partnership, DAI led THINKMD’s latest financing round, joined by Fresh Tracks Capital and select private investors.

DAI, a global development company, has an operational track record in more than 150 countries across multiple sectors and has established a leadership position in the international development space. The firm recently launched a business unit focused on global health and healthcare analytics. THINKMD is an early-stage global healthcare innovation company dedicated to expanding healthcare capacity and access to services worldwide. THINKMD’s first product, MEDSINC, is a mobile clinical assessment platform that enables anyone anywhere to assess the sickness of a child, and provide triage and treatment recommendations.

“DAI is focused on next-generation health and technology innovations that will make a powerful difference on a global scale,” said [Chris LeGrand](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/leadership/christopher-legrand), President of DAI Global Health. “In THINKMD, we have a partner whose technology and values are a perfect complement to our vision for the future of healthcare globally. We look forward to working with the team to realize the potential of THINKMD’s world-class clinical tools.”

A novel, simple-to-use clinical assessment tool delivered on a mobile phone and readily deployed by minimally skilled health workers, MEDSINC is specifically designed to extend existing health workforces to reach more people with better health services. MEDSINC transforms a mobile device into a self-training, patient-centric tool that enables non-health professionals such as community health workers, parents, and caregivers to gather critical patient information, generate an integrated clinical assessment, and share it with their healthcare providers. Its remote clinical assessment capabilities have the potential to improve care, save lives, and reduce unnecessary healthcare expenditures in underserved communities all over the world. MEDSINC also captures critical real-time public health data that can offer a unique look at population health, disease burden, and pandemic threats.

DAI and THINKMD first connected through the *[Innovation into Action Challenge](https://www.dai.com/news/innovation-action-challenge-winners-chosen)*, a competition launched last year to surface innovative ideas, products, and services in the field of international development. As a Challenge winner, THINKMD worked with DAI to coordinate a field test of MEDSINC with Ecuador’s Ministry of Health.
