DAI is pleased to announce that it has been granted membership by the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN), the operational arm of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As a CTCN member, DAI is prequalified to bid on opportunities from various funders to deliver technical assistance in developing countries. Membership also provides a platform for DAI’s [projects in environment and energy](https://www.dai.com/our-work/the-projects?filter=environment-and-energy) to showcase new technologies, experiences, and approaches through CTCN events and information channels. CTCN also comprises a network of decision makers, thought leaders, and organizations with whom DAI can explore partnerships.

“To join the CTCN, DAI had to highlight our experience in [climate change adaptation and mitigation programs](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/the-whole-spectrum-a-holistic-approach-to-climate-resilience/?utm_source=daidotcom) in developing countries, including in providing technical assistance, information services, and knowledge exchange and how we support collaboration among diverse stakeholders,” said [Andrew Watson](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/andrew-watson), managing director of DAI’s [Environment](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/environment-and-energy) sector.

Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, the [CTCN](https://www.ctc-n.org/) was established in 2010 at the request of developing countries to accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound technologies for low carbon and climate resilient development. The CTCN operates as a country-driven, demand-driven network collaborator. Developing country National Designated Entities submit requests for technical assistance to support the transfer of technologies that address climate change. The CTCN then works through a competitive bidding process of its prequalified network of experts, now including DAI, to develop tailored solutions. More than 80 percent of requests have come from low- and lower-middle income countries.
 
In 2017, the CTCN has received requests from more than 70 countries. Most are seeking assistance in climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies to help fulfill their Nationally Determined Contributions—the commitments made at the Paris Agreement in 2015.

For example, in the past year, CTCN supported the development of an Energy Efficiency Master Plan in Tonga, through a partnership with the Green Climate Fund (GCF). DAI also serves as a GCF Accredited Observer. In Ghana, the Centre is helping improve dry season planning and management, and in Burma, also known as Myanmar, CTCN is actively supporting data-gathering systems to support the country’s planning and adaptation efforts in the water and agriculture sectors.

“As a global company, we strive to engage in new partnerships and take part in global networks such as CTCN,” Watson said. “As a CTCN member, we are able to strengthen our partnership with the Global Climate Fund and support activities that focus on capacity building and climate technologies.” DAI is also a member of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition—a similar partnership initiative led by the World Bank that seeks to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.
