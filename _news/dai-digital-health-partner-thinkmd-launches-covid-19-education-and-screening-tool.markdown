[THINKMD](https://thinkmd.org/), a DAI Global Health digital partner, launched its free COVID-19 education and health screening tool this week through the THINKMD website. In the coming week, THINKMD will release the tool in targeted launches with telecommunications partners in Africa and South Asia. The initial launch will be in Egypt, with multiple geographies to follow.

“Globally, and specifically in resource-limited settings, the most pressing need is real-time epidemiologic health data to identify populations where COVID-19 is emerging and expanding,” said Dr. [Barry Finette](https://thinkmd.org/team/barry-finette/), THINKMD’s Founder and CEO. “Our tool can help capture that critical health data and inform responses to this pandemic—that’s why we’re working to distribute it as widely and as rapidly as we can.”

Designed to generate actionable epidemiological health data in the absence of widespread testing facilities, THINKMD’s COVID-19 screening tool guides users through a self-assessment that determines if an individual has none, some, or many of the clinical symptoms and presenting features associated with COVID-19. 

It also provides general information about the virus as well as health-seeking, protective, and preventive educational information based on World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. THINKMD’s progressive web application currently functions on any smartphone or tablet and THINKMD is working on a version for feature phones as well to ensure equitable access and maximum adoption globally, even in areas with limited cellular and internet capabilities. 

To bring this technology to scale, THINKMD is partnering with [Mondia](https://mondia.com/), a digital technology company that delivers content and digital services to more than a billion people through its relationships with multinational mobile network operators. Using the Mondia platform, THINKMD will distribute the tool free of charge to populations in Africa and Asia, starting with this week’s release in Egypt that will reach 90 million mobile users on the Vodafone network. 

“We’re proud to see THINKMD deliver and scale this effective and much-needed tool,” said [Bobby Jefferson](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bobby-jefferson), DAI Global Health Chief Technology Officer. “DAI is eager to do everything we can to help THINKMD continue to put this technology in the hands of those who need it.”

“Our objective with this technology is really two-fold,” said [Nick Donowitz](https://thinkmd.org/team/nick-donowitz/), THINKMD’s Chief Strategy Officer. “We aim to help users better understand their health status and the risks involved with COVID-19, while also rapidly acquiring critical, geo-tagged population health and epidemiological data to enhance disease surveillance and response. Once we have launched in a region, we’ll be able to provide aggregated data directly to health ministries and international health agencies to inform their response efforts. We’re looking for partners who can help us bring this technology to more users.”
