[Ilm Ideas][1] Communications Specialist Saad Hamid was one of 26 social entrepreneurs selected globally to present at the inaugural Telenor Youth Summit on December 9–11 in Oslo, Norway.

![Hamid][2]{:.float-left}Hamid was chosen for his idea, the "60-Second Education," a solution for filtering information from the web, social media, TV, and radio, and then curating short, simple, and relevant bits to educate young people using video, audio, text, and images.

Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and implemented by DAI, Ilm Ideas supports education initiatives throughout Pakistan, where millions of children are unable to attend school. Hamid plans to adapt "60-Second Education" to collate and communicate solutions from the Ilm Ideas portfolio of grantees to inform teachers, students, and activists.

One of the world's leading mobile operators, the Telenor Group launched its youth summit to convene leaders from the millennial generation—young people born into technology—to use their collective knowledge to address social and economic challenges through mobile technology.
