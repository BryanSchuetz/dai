A recent story in the [_Developments_][1] newsletter struck a chord throughout DAI and beyond. The story, titled "Results-Based Financing in Action: Cambodia MSME," by Shannon Sarbo and David Hill, described how a DAI-led project in Cambodia connected 67,000 very poor, rural people with piped drinking water by incentivizing water service providers (WSPs) to run the connections.

DAI has now released a white paper that elaborates on how the [Cambodia Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Project][2] incentivized the private sector to upgrade and expand its piped water delivery systems into poor, rural areas. Written by Hill, Curtis Hundley, and [Del McCluskey][3], the paper reports how the rush by WSPs to connect customers and collect rebates did not come at the expense of water quality, in part because incentive rebates were contingent on meeting the Ministry of Industry's standards for clean drinking water.
