We are delighted to report that DAI—through [DAI Magister](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-magister-the-leading-capital-advisor-and-investment-bank-for-international-and-emerging-markets), the investment fundraising and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory arm of [DAI Capital](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/dai-capital)—served as co-advisor for Capricorn Digital (trading as Baxi) in its just-announced [purchase by MFS Africa](https://qz.com/africa/2078996/mfs-africa-bought-baxis-agent-banking-for-cross-border-trade/). Baxi is one of Nigeria’s most prominent financial technology enterprises while South Africa-based MFS is one of the continent’s leading financial tech players.
 
This is thought to be Nigeria's [second-largest](https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/) financial tech M&A transaction on record (the largest was Stripe’s $200 million purchase of Paystack last year) the deal represents a landmark for the continent: the first-ever tech acquisition by a South African firm in Nigeria. It also highlights a number of key trends in Africa’s rapidly growing financial tech sector:
 
* This has been a record year for African financial tech, with more than $800 million in deals to date. We expect the sector will see values rise toward $5 billion annually in the coming years.
* M&A will emerge as a key trend alongside larger fundraises, as companies such as MFS build continental leadership. After the sales of Paystack, Direct Pay Online Group, and now Baxi, many leading financial tech firms will consider both M&A and other fundraising vehicles as viable options to achieve scale.
* The continent remains heavily unbanked, with companies far more reliant on cash than in developed markets, suggesting continued opportunity to bring value to the market and facilitate higher valuations.
 
DAI is proud to have brokered this deal and looks forward to continued investment in the Nigerian financial technology sector.
