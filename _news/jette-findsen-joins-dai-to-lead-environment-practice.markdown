[Jette Findsen](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/jette-findsen) has joined DAI as Vice President, Environment. At DAI, she will oversee a portfolio of projects and lead DAI’s strategy for climate change programs with the U.S. Government. She will also provide cross-sector assistance to projects focused on green finance, natural resources, water and waste management, clean energy, greenhouse gas management, carbon markets, and economic analysis of climate change mitigation and adaptation options.

![1 Jette-1ce4ee.jpg](/uploads/1%20Jette-1ce4ee.jpg){:.float-left}“The economic havoc caused by COVID-19 and the scale of the climate crisis demand that we use all available tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and equitably as possible, and take an active role in helping vulnerable communities build resilience to the impacts of a changing climate,” Findsen said. “In past decades, we have focused on developing the science and protocols for assessing the problem. Now we need to focus on good governance as a framework for equitable, vibrant, low-carbon, and resilient communities, and on creating an enabling environment for mobilizing green finance at scale.”

Findsen has a wealth of experience working internationally and domestically on issues related to climate change, natural resources management, environmental protection, clean energy, green buildings, water and wastewater management, and climate finance. She previously worked as the Senior Program Officer, Climate Investment Standards at the American Carbon Registry, where she led an initiative to standardize the quantification of environmental impacts of green bonds and other green debt instruments. She also worked as a Senior Associate and Climate Change Coordinator at Abt Associates, where she launched an international and domestic climate change practice. 

Previously, she led LEIDOS’ climate change practice, assisting federal agencies, state and local governments, financial institutions, utilities, and international development institutions with climate and sustainability planning in the transportation, energy, waste, water, forestry, and agriculture sectors. She managed LEIDOS’ contract to help the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) develop a reporting system for its mandatory Greenhous Gas Reporting Program—which tracks facility-level emissions from the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States—and she developed greenhouse gas inventory and carbon offsets protocols for the Climate Action Reserve, the Climate Registry, and the EPA Climate Leaders program. 

Findsen serves on the Anne Arundel County Maryland, Citizen Environmental Commission, and as an advisor on greenhouse gas management for the Water Research Foundation.
