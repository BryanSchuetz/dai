DAI is delighted to announce that Michael Jakobowski has joined the firm as Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

Jakobowski has more than 20 years of management and consulting experience, including in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, business process integration, and 11 years in public accounting with Price Waterhouse, Coopers & Lybrand, and Johnson Lambert.

Most recently, he served as CFO for Mission Essentials Personnel (MEP), which provides human capital solutions—principally language and training services—to government and corporate clients via a staff of 8,000 personnel in 13 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. At MEP, he led a team of 60 staff responsible for all finance functions: reporting, forecasting, treasury, pricing and proposal support, quality assurance, information technology, and regulatory compliance.

"Mike will be a powerful addition to our finance team," said DAI President and Chief Executive Officer [James Boomgard][1]. "He brings new skills and perspectives to our company, allied with great energy, discipline, and a collaborative approach that will serve him well as he applies those skills in the international development arena."

Jakobowski has significant experience working at senior executive levels in growing businesses. Before joining MEP, he served for more than 10 years as CFO and as Senior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives for Cambridge Information Group, a Bethesda, Maryland-based firm that oversaw several portfolio companies with consolidated annual revenue of $600 million and 2,000 employees worldwide.

A Certified Public Accountant, Jakobowski earned his B.S. degree in accounting from the University of Maryland. He lives in Bethesda.
