On June 26, DAI officially launched the [Promoting Integrity in the Public Sector Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-promoting-integrity-in-the-public-sector-activity-pro-integrity), known as “Pro-Integrity,” funded by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (UKAid). The largest anticorruption initiative in Ukraine’s history, the Pro-Integrity program aims to bolster Ukraine's efforts to combat corruption and enhance transparency across all levels of governance.

In his opening remarks, USAID Ukraine Mission Director Jim Hope said: *“Today were here to announce the launch of the 90-million-dollar program, called “Promotion of Public Sector Program, known as “Pro-Integrity”. It is a milestone in a shared partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. A partnership is a keyword; it’s a partnership about commitment to promoting integrity. Promoting integrity to defeat corruption is essential to our shared goals of Ukrainian victory on the battlefield and the transformation of Ukraine into a democratic, prosperous, and sovereign partner that is fully integrated into the European Union and NATO. In addition to the continuing to strengthen national anti-corruption institutions Pro-integrity will expand its work to the local level and help increase its focus in promoting integrity in recovery and reconstruction.  Project will also work with civil society and media, because they have essential role in helping to shine a light on corruption and ensuring that resources are used in a public interest.”*

The Pro-Integrity project is a five-year program co-funded by USAID and UKAid and implemented by DAI. This substantial commitment is dedicated to advancing Ukraine's ongoing fight against corruption, focusing on three primary objectives:

1. Strengthening National Anti-Corruption Institutional Capacity: Enhancing the ability of national institutions to prevent, detect, and deter corruption.

2. Bolstering Anti-Corruption Compliance and Control in Local Governance: Ensuring robust compliance and control mechanisms at the local level.

3. Advancing Transparency and Accountability in Resilience, Recovery, and Reconstruction Efforts: Promoting transparency and accountability in Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction processes.

The program will engage a wide range of stakeholders at the national, regional, and municipal levels. This includes specialized anti-corruption institutions within the Government of Ukraine, local government entities, the Ukrainian private sector, and civil society organizations. By involving a broad spectrum of actors in the governance sphere, the Pro-Integrity project aims to create a comprehensive and sustainable anti-corruption framework.

The project also lays the groundwork for future reconstruction efforts, ensuring they are transparent and inclusive. The Pro-Integrity project emphasizes robust support for local governments and recovery processes at the municipal level. This local focus ensures that the project's benefits are felt throughout the country, from national institutions to individual communities.
