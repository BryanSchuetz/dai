The U.S. Agency for International Development-funded [Business Egypt](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/egypt-business-egypt) project, in partnership with Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation, recently [launched](https://www.facebook.com/USAIDEgypt/posts/pfbid0YDvaxmb1bN6YZjrcuvuZbUPHEuKK6LgrPGR3tNbNGCZmsz1ornMQSXX2bfeRcqkBl) the [ClimaTech Run](https://climatechrun.com/) global competition, which invites tech entrepreneurs and digital artists with innovative ideas on climate action to compete for an opportunity to present their work at COP27. 

The initiative is part of the country’s efforts to combat climate change ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference 2022 ([COP27](https://sdg.iisd.org/events/2021-un-climate-change-conference-unfccc-cop-27/)), which Egypt is set to host November 6-18 in Sharm El-Sheikh.

The DAI-led Business Egypt team is managing the [online platform](https://climatechrun.com/) for the competition, providing virtual space for sharing ideas and designing climate solutions.

“There is a role for all of us in climate action,” said H.E. Dr. Rania A. Al-Mashat, Minister of International Cooperation. “The youth are especially fundamental in finding new, innovative solutions.”

The competition has two complementary tracks: the first for global tech startups (ICT for Climate Action), the second for digital artists (DigitalArt4Climate). Ten shortlisted candidates will compete for a grand prize of $100,000, and there will be a top African startup prize of $50,000. The application window closes September 22. For the DigitalArt4Climate track, a public vote in late September will select those artists who best express the concept of climate action.
