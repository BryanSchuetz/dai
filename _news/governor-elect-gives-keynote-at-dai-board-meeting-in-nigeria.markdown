DAI’s Board was treated to a keynote speech by Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Governor-Elect or Ekiti State, in Nigeria as part of its quarterly [meeting](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-board-members-engage-with-partners-and-projects-in-nairobi-kenya), which is held once per year in a country where DAI works. 

DAI has made major commitments in Nigeria in the last few years, with the hiring of [Dr. Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah) and the merger with [GRID Consulting](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-forces-with-nigerias-grid-consulting). 

Our work in Nigeria has improved domestic resource mobilization at the state and local government level, improved and increased access to maternal and child health services in northern Nigeria, laid the groundwork for systematic improvements in water resource management, enhanced the productivity of commercial food companies and distribution, and enacted the policy reforms needed to promote private sector growth, among other results. 

The transcript of Dr. Fayemi’s speech follows:
