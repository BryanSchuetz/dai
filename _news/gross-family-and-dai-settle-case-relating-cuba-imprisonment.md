Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Judy Gross today announced the settlement of the lawsuit brought by Judy and Alan Gross against DAI in the wake of Alan Gross's imprisonment by Cuban authorities in December 2009 for his work for DAI to implement the U.S. Government's Cuba Program.

The parties agreed to a settlement in which neither admits fault. DAI has agreed to pay an undisclosed monetary amount to help address the injuries the Gross family has sustained in connection with Alan's arrest and imprisonment in Cuba. DAI and Judy Gross have also agreed to continue working together to seek Alan's release.

"We are very pleased that DAI has committed to help address the injuries sustained by our family," said Judy Gross. "We want Alan back home, safe and sound," she said.

"We have been clear from day one that Alan's safe return to his family is our first priority," said [Jim Boomgard][1], DAI's President and CEO. "Settling this litigation allows us to work together on that overriding goal, which should be the focus for everyone involved in this case." Dr. Boomgard described Alan Gross as "a committed development professional with many years of experience providing humanitarian and development assistance worldwide."

DAI was chosen by USAID to implement the U.S. Government's Cuba Program through an open bidding process. Since 1970, DAI has worked in more than 150 countries, tackling development problems caused by inefficient markets, ineffective governance, or instability and delivering results across the spectrum of international development contexts, from stable societies and high-growth economies to challenging environments racked by political or military conflict.

The U.S. Government, which is also a defendant in the lawsuit, did not participate in the settlement.
