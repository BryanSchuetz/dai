Led by [Kosmos Energy](http://www.kosmosenergy.com/index.php), the KIC facilitates the development of entrepreneurs and businesses, with a focus on the agribusiness sector. DAI [supports](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-kosmos-innovation-center-kic) the design and delivery of the entrepreneurship and leadership program, providing capacity building support, personnel recruitment and management, stakeholder engagement, investment due diligence, and ongoing technical assistance. Ghana’s [Meltwater Entrepreneurship School of Technology (MEST)](https://meltwater.org/) also provides technical training to KIC entrepreneurs and incubation services to winners of KIC seed funding. 

The prestigious award is presented to the winning partnership during the Concordia Annual Summit that takes place alongside the UN General Assembly in New York on September 24–25.

“The KIC is equipping Ghana’s next generation of business leaders to run stable, profitable businesses delivering much-needed services,” said George Sarpong, Director of External Affairs at Kosmos Energy. “The businesses we have supported so far will go on to grow and employ hundreds more people over the coming years, contributing greatly to the country’s economic development. It is a great honor for the KIC to have the achievements of the entrepreneurs we have supported recognized, as well as the time and effort of our partners—DAI and MEST—by this international award.”

“The KIC is a standout example of how a private business can work with local partners to create social good and have a long-lasting positive impact in a community,” said [Zachary Kaplan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/zachary-kaplan), Director of DAI’s Sustainable Business Group.
