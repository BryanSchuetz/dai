Code Partners, a new coding academy based in Montgomery County, Maryland, held its official launch event at DAI headquarters this week. The academy is designed to train the next generation of software and web developers to meet the hiring needs of local business and organizations. Based on the nationally recognized curriculum developed by [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) in Seattle, Code Partners will teach motivated students to become full-stack web or software developers in 20 weeks. After completing the curriculum, 95 percent of students have been hired within six months.

DAI and [United Solutions](http://www.unitedsolutions.biz/Portal/WebPage.html?objectID=27669&referenceID=27669&referenceType=Object) co-founded Code Partners to help develop the technical skills of the local workforce and make Maryland a new center of innovation in the country.

“Code Partners will be a talent resource for the private sector and government in the county and the region,” said Doug McLean, Vice President for Partnerships at DAI. David Nguyen, founder and CEO of United Solutions added, “Our goal is to change the face of coding by building a diversified group of programmers committed to innovation.”

Mitch Robertson, Vice President of Code Fellows, traveled from Seattle for the event and provided the keynote address to the audience of local businesses and DAI leadership.

“Never before in history have we had something like coding, where you can take advantage of quality job opportunities no matter where you live and no matter who you are, and Code Fellows is excited to be a part of that movement,” said Robertson. “When we first met, it was apparent how in line DAI was with what we do, their entrepreneurial spirit was a big part of making Code Partners happen.”

Robertson also highlighted Code Fellows’ success in linking graduates to jobs at Amazon in Seattle. Montgomery county recently made the shortlist for Amazon’s second headquarters.

Code Partners will offer classes for students with a range of coding experience, and accommodates both new entrants to the workforce as well as career changers. Initial courses cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with advanced courses planned for Python and ASP.NET. Code Partners will hold its first Code 101: Intro to Software Development & Careers in Tech courses on [February 24](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-101-intro-to-software-development-careers-in-tech-tickets-42538303210?aff=dainews) and [March 10](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-101-intro-to-software-development-careers-in-tech-tickets-42718463073?aff=dainews) at DAI offices in Bethesda.
