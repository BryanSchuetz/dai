The COVID-19 pandemic poses an increasingly severe challenge to developing countries, particularly the least developed. A [recent estimate](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/news/2020/COVID19_Crisis_in_developing_countries_threatens_devastate_economies.html) from UNDP sees their income loss exceeding $220 billion. DAI and the [European Centre for Development Policy Management](https://ecdpm.org/) (ECDPM) today announced a [series of webinars](https://ecdpm.org/events/connecting-public-private-responses-to-covid-19-and-impact-global-development/) designed to engage and inform global development stakeholders seeking to mount an effective response to the COVID-19 crisis.

As a global company implementing development programming in more than 100 countries—including many of the world’s most challenging environments—DAI is building on its in-house expertise and multiclient experience to share knowledge and identify innovative solutions applicable to the COVID-19 crisis. DAI’s teams are in close communication with donors and partner country stakeholders to coordinate an effective response to the pandemic. Our in-house technical staff are developing toolkits, response strategies, digital approaches and solutions, and ways of [adapting to COVID-19](https://www.dai.com/covid-19) by project, context, and sector.

As a leading think-and-do tank on sustainable development policies and practices, ECDPM has mobilised its expertise and key network—from policy makers and knowledge institutions to business associations and development financiers—to reflect on how best to address the [challenges of the pandemic](https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/covid-19-international-cooperation/), and how COVID-19 may affect EU-Africa relations and the prospects for development and international cooperation more broadly.

## Practical Webinars 

DAI and ECDPM are collaborating to share this growing body of knowledge and engage with our partners and clients through [practical webinars](https://ecdpm.org/events/connecting-public-private-responses-to-covid-19-and-impact-global-development/) addressing their main priorities. DAI-ECDPM webinars bring together public and private practitioners to reflect on the immediate reaction of the development community and support the post-pandemic global response of the EU, in line with its recent [Communication](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/system/files/joint-comm-2020-eu-global-response_en.pdf).

The webinars will be recorded and remain available on DAI’s and ECDPM’s websites. [REGISTER HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOdqi6h0aCwizEHZdZIVIOX_JsVFS0pzJjbTj8E5982rjJNw/viewform).

### Webinar 1: Strengthening MSMEs for economic resilience and sustainable development

<div>
  <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 15, 9am–10:15am (Eastern Daylight Time); 3pm–4:15pm (Central European Summer Time) </span>
</div>

**Description:** Micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are dramatically affected by the coronavirus pandemic all over the world. The crisis has revealed their vulnerability to the supply and demand side, and as per a recent OECD paper, there is a serious risk that more than 50 percent of them will not survive the next few months. 

In low-income countries, formal and informal MSMEs are significant engines of growth, employment, innovation, and social development. This webinar will showcase public and private sector initiatives to support MSMEs in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, and discuss how governments and development partners could further engage with the private sector to pave the way to a quicker and environmentally sustainable economy recovery in developing countries.

**Description:** Since the coronavirus outbreak, notwithstanding national strategies to cope with the pandemic, digital tools have globally kept us at work, allowed families and friends to meet virtually, and helped young people keep learning and studying. 

The EU has been supporting and advocating an inclusive digital transformation inside and outside its borders for many years. But the coronavirus pandemic is fast forwarding us into the fourth industrial revolution and calls for rapid actions to support this transition. 

How can the EU best support countries that sometimes still lack the necessary infrastructure and equipment to deploy e-solutions, or where people’s livelihood rely on informal day-by-day income generating activities? This webinar brings together specialists to discuss this accelerated digitalisation of developing countries’ economies, and how can the EU support this transition to ensure no one is left behind.
