Last week, the First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, took the opportunity to launch the Scottish Government’s Climate Just Communities (CJC) program during his introduction to a lecture by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry at the Edinburgh International Festival. 

The CJC program will run in Malawi, Rwanda, and Zambia, working with local communities— including marginalized groups—to identify their own priorities and build their resilience to the climate crisis.

“The countries which are the worst affected by the climate crisis are often those which have done little or nothing to cause it,” said the First Minister. “The injustice at the heart of the global climate crisis is why Scotland became the first country in the world to establish a Climate Justice Fund more than a decade ago and why we have led the way in being the first global north country to commit funding to address loss and damage.” 
 
DAI will deliver the project in Malawi over the next three years with our partners IIED, LINK Education International, LINK Community Development, Water Witness International, and Water Witness Malawi. 

“We are delighted to be working alongside our colleagues from the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and NIRAS on this ambitious program,” said Project Director Ingrid Kelling, referring to the lead implementing partners in Rwanda and Zambia, respectively. “Thanks to the commitment of the Scottish Government, our experienced team in Malawi and our partners will use the program to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by the climate crisis and work with private and public sector leaders to improve climate justice.”
