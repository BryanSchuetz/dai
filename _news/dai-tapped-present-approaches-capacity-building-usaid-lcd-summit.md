Two DAI projects will be highlighted at the U.S. Agency for International Develoment (USAID)'s Local Capacity Development Summit, June 18-19.

The first, a paper on the [Africa Leadership Training and][1][ Capacity Building Program (Africa Lead)][1] project, focuses on techniques used to make emotional connections with training participants and will be discussed by the project's leader and DAI Board Member, [David Tardif-Douglin.][2] The paper, presented during the plenary session on June 18, also goes into detail about how to engage with trainees long after the training is over.

The second is a paper describing DAI's local capacity building successes on the worldwide project [Stamping Out Pandemic and Avian Influenza (STOP AI)][3]. It will be presented by DAI's longtime global health specialist and Board Member, [Jerry Martin][4]. Martin will discuss the paper during an afternoon breakout session June 19 focusing on tools and strategies to build capacity at the community level.

The STOP AI paper highlights lessons learned from cascade training, an approach that identifies people on the ground who speak the local language, and trains them to become master trainers able to train others. STOP AI used skills practices and experiential learning, alongside tabletop simulations to address some of the communications and systemic issues.
