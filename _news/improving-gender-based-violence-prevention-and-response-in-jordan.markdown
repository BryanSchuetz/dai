Gender-based violence is a pressing issue in Jordan and the broader Middle East, and while it disproportionately harms women and girls, men and people living with disabilities are affected, too. To support prevention efforts in the Kingdom of Jordan, DAI is proud to partner with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on a new initiative, the [*Himaya* Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/jordan-himaya-activity). 

The Jordanian government has actively addressed gender-based violence through policies, laws, and awareness campaigns, but much work remains to be done. Recent studies have revealed that a significant number of Jordanian women experience abuse, but only a small percentage report it. Reporting of abuse suffered by men, boys, and marginalized groups is thought to be even lower.

Violence survivors face many challenges when going through the protection system. They are often too intimidated to report their cases to the Family and Juvenile Protection Department due to fear of family disapproval and other social repercussions. Those who do report face questioning and enjoy little to no confidentiality or protection. 

Working closely with the Jordanian National Protection Team, other government officials, and local partners, Himaya will support their efforts to build the capacity of service provider institutions, bolster the legislative frameworks for providing protection and responding to violence, and design and implement interventions to improve the infrastructure supporting gender-based violence survivors. 

These activities will include strengthening the capacity of Ministry of Social Development units and civil society actors to refer cases and provide essential services, improving the ability of health service providers to identify cases and provide confidential care, and assisting judicial institutions to manage and prosecute cases. 

“The design of USAID *Himaya* Activity offers a unique opportunity to work with Jordanian gender-based violence protection partners to leverage their strengths and collaboratively design holistic solutions towards a more effective, responsive, and survivor-centered protection system,” said Diala Kharma, the  Chief of Party. “With DAI’s global expertise, strong national partners, and committed stakeholders, the *Himaya* team looks forward to effecting meaningful change and sustainable impact over the coming five years.

“In Arabic, *Himaya* means protection," she added. “USAID’s *Himaya* Activity is committed to living up to its name.”
