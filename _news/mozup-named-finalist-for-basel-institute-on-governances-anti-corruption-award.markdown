MozUp, the [Enterprise Development Center](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-enterprise-development-center) in Mozambique, has been selected as one of three finalists for the [Basel Institute on Governance's Anti-Corruption Collective Action award](https://collective-action.com/get-involved/awards/). Presented annually, the award recognizes initiatives that contribute to the fight against corruption. [MozUp](https://mozup.org/) was nominated by the [Ethics Institute,](https://www.tei.org.za/) an independent institute in South Africa that works to strengthen the ethical standards of businesses and organizations internationally.

MozUp partnered with the Ethics Institute to develop and deliver a Key Principles of Business Ethics seminar. The seminar is tailored to the Mozambican context and provides businesses with the tools they need to implement ethical practices.

"We are honored to be selected as a finalist for this award and are proud of our work with the Ethics Institute," said [Barbara Habib](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/barbara-habib), MozUp's Director. "By empowering local companies with tools to practice ethical business, we help to support a sustainable, competitive, and transparent operating environment that improves the overall success of the business and encourages additional investment and development in the local economy."

Working with local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), MozUp provides training, mentoring, and networking opportunities to improve business processes, management, and overall operations, including the promotion of ethical business practices.
