DAI today announced it will work with Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd (EEPGL), an affiliate of ExxonMobil, to support EEPGL’s establishment of the Centre for Local Business Development in Georgetown, Guyana. The Centre, which will commence operations in July, will assist small- and medium-sized Guyanese businesses to grow their capacity and improve competitiveness in a variety of sectors. 



“We are delighted to support ExxonMobil in its work to develop local businesses and drive inclusive economic growth,” said [Zachary Kaplan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/zachary-kaplan), Director of DAI’s [Energy and Resources Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/corporate-sustainability).

“The Centre for Local Business Development is an investment in the people of Guyana and the future of the country. ExxonMobil is proud to assist in designing and opening this important resource center,” said Rod Henson, country manager for ExxonMobil in Guyana. “The Centre will play a key role in furthering the capabilities of local businesses that we are eager to partner with.” 

The Centre will initially prioritize skills development in various sectors that support the oil and gas industry, including safety equipment and personnel, marine operations, offshore supply, and civil construction. It will also provide tailored mentoring, coaching, and access to financial support.

“Local suppliers are important to the success of EEPGL’s operations,” said Henson. “Through the Centre, we will continue working with these and other stakeholders to develop local companies and help build a competitive industrial base.”

Once operational, the Centre will be a reliable source of information on technical standards, procurement opportunities, and project-specific information. EEPGL, its contractors, the broader oil and gas industry, and the government will be able to utilize the Centre to source local vendors and services. Following its opening, DAI will work over a three-year period to transition management of the Centre to Guyanese management.
