The [Finance for Climate Change Innovation Fund (FICCF)](http://ficcf.com/index.php/climate-smart-agriculture/csa), operated by a DAI-led project, recently held a [two-day conference](https://www.climatesmartag.org/) in Nairobi to share achievements under the Climate Smart Agriculture pilot.
 
The FICCF is promoting the transition to climate-smart agriculture in Kenya through support to microfinance institutions partnering with agribusiness aggregators and smallholder farmers to adopt a range of tools and practices to de-risk production and build resilience to increasingly variable climate. 

The FICCF is managed by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)-funded https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-strengthening-adaptation-and-resilience-climate-change-kenya-plus-starck programme. 
 
The oversubscribed event saw over 140 participants join representing MFIs, insurance and climate information services partners, agribusiness aggregators, project implementers, research and development partners, government institutions as well as cassava, sorghum and dairy farmers from Kisumu, Homa Bay, Nyandarua counties. The diversity of participants – from sub-county to capital and from field to executive boardrooms – was well received and generated engaging interactions during the breakout sessions.
 
The conference was organised around 5 sessions covering the key layers of the FICCF CSA pilot: Finance, Climate Information Services, Insurance, Technical Services and Partnerships. During the breakout session, participants discussed the opportunities to adapt and scale up the CSA model capable to attract external investors. In addition, 15 exhibition booths were on display for participants to meet agri-businesses, insurance and technical service providers engaged in the various commodities.
 
Through detailed accounts in each of the value-chains, we heard how FICCF set up a range of partnerships with commercial and market players to test a package of services to farmers to de-risk farm investments and build resilience.
 
Through matching grants and partnership facilitation by FICCF, MFIs highlighted the importance of technical services and climate information services and how access to this knowledge has translated into farmers producing more, throughout the year and better managing their risks.
 
Greater productivity at the farm level translates into a greater ability to borrow and invest. Ann Maina, Managing Director INUKA MFI, summarised the financial inclusion benefits of the FICCF as she explained “we are projecting longer relationship with these farmers and developing other products for them”. Through FICCF, INUKA has also leveraged additional capital funds from the MasterCard Foundation.
 
The Head of DFID Kenya, Pete Vowles, along with Sabita Thapa, lead Climate Advisor, communicated their gratitude towards the DAI FICCF team recognising the intensity of effort required in developing innovative partnerships between value-chain actors. They also reiterated the contribution of the FICCF CSA pilot towards resilience building in Kenya and that climate resilience was a high priority area for DFID.
 
The FICCF is a component of the StARCK+ programme, a 4-year (2013-2017) DFID funded programme seeking to support Kenya’s efforts in addressing climate change through private sector engagement, improved governance and civil society capacity.
