Hale emphasized the important role that the tourism and hospitality sectors play within the national economy, saying, "Today, we celebrate our joint efforts to highlight the very best of what Lebanon offersâ€”to both the tourist and the investor. I want to thank the Lebanese Minister of Tourism, H. E. Michel Pharaon, for recognizing that tourism matters to people, the economy, and the growth and prosperity of this nation. I encourage Lebanese to tour their own country this year and see the sites that have inspired so many foreign visitors to your land."
