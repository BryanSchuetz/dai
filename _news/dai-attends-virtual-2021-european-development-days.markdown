DAI is pleased to have been present at the [European Development Days (EDD)](https://eudevdays.eu/) on June 15-16. This year’s focus was the Green Deal for a Sustainable Future, and we hosted a virtual stand in the EDD Global Village to showcase our work with the European Union (EU) Delegation to Ethiopia and Ministry of Agriculture to mainstream climate-smart approaches in the [Productive Safety Net Programme (Climate-Smart PSNP).](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-technical-assistance-to-support-gcca-plus-mainstreaming-of-climate-smart-planning-and-implementation-approaches) 

Our in-house and project specialists were present on the stand throughout the event, to showcase achievements and innovations emerging from the project. 

DAI also hosted two digital side meetings: 

* On Tuesday, June 15, a session was held focusing on DAI’s climate business and select EU-funded projects, including our technical assistance projects to the [Global Covenant of Mayors](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/support-the-secretariat-of-the-global-covenant-of-mayors-for-climate-and-energy), [Morocco—Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-morseff), [Bhutan—Decentralisation and Renewable Natural Resource Management](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/bhutan-decentralisation-and-renewable-natural-resource-management), and the [Technical Support to the EU LIFE Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-support-eu-life-programme).
