DAI is pleased to have been present at the [European Development Days (EDD)](https://eudevdays.eu/) on June 15-16. This year’s focus was the Green Deal for a Sustainable Future, and we hosted a virtual stand in the EDD Global Village to showcase our work with the European Union (EU) Delegation to Ethiopia and Ministry of Agriculture to mainstream climate-smart approaches in the [Productive Safety Net Programme (Climate-Smart PSNP).](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-technical-assistance-to-support-gcca-plus-mainstreaming-of-climate-smart-planning-and-implementation-approaches) 

Our in-house and project specialists were present on the stand throughout the event, to showcase achievements and innovations emerging from the project.
