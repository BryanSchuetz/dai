A consortium of partners comprising Development Data, [DAI Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health), Disacare, Transaid, and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) are working with the National Malaria Elimination Centre (NMEC) in Zambia to scale up the highly successful [MAMaZ against Malaria (MAM) pilot project](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/zambia-pilot-shows-how-to-scale-relief-for-children-suffering-from-malaria). This news comes after securing matched funding from Grand Challenges Canada (GCC) and the Government of Canada that will allow the project to benefit around four times as many people living in rural Zambia—from 54,000 to 200,000. 

The new project—MAMaZ against Malaria at Scale—follows a 12-month pilot from 2017 to 2018, which reduced severe malaria fatality by 96 percent (from 8 percent to 0.25 percent) in Serenje district. This success was achieved through effective community engagement, a functioning drug supply chain, implementing an innovative emergency transport system for patients using bicycle ambulances and increased access to key medicines for severe malaria.

Caroline Barber, CEO of Transaid, says: “Together with our partners, this new 18-month project will see us supporting a four-fold increase in population coverage with the potential to reach five districts, 200 communities and 38 health facilities, and save hundreds more lives. The consortium will provide strategic and technical support to NMEC as Zambia transitions to scale.”

Tendayi Kureya, the CEO of Development Data says, “In Zambia, our government is determined to eliminate malaria by 2030. This project, when fully implemented in all the districts where needed, will go a very long way in cutting child deaths due to malaria. The current funding will take us to five districts and 200,000 people. Further funding will be needed to reach all those at risk in the country.”

The project will continue to see the MAM at Scale consortium in collaboration with NMEC procure WHO quality assured Rectal Artesunate (RAS) 100mg –used to help manage severe malaria in children less than six years old at a community level before they are referred to a healthcare facility to receive injectable artesunate.

“Malaria can become deadly all too quickly, especially for children under 5 living far from health facilities,” said George Jagoe, Head of Access & Product Management, MMV. “The dramatic 96% reduction in case fatality achieved by the pilot project, demonstrates not only the undeniable benefit of using RAS and emergency transport in tandem but also the incredible life-saving impact this project could have at full scale in Zambia as well as other high-burden malaria countries.”

Footnotes
1 Expected deaths calculated based on the case fatality rate measured during the baseline (8 per cent) and the elevated suspected severe malaria cases (1,215 cases) measured during the project compared to the baseline (224 cases), the project would have expected 97 deaths without any intervention.

Notes to editors 

This project is undertaken with the financial support of Grand Challenges Canada and the Government of Canada, through Global Affairs Canada (GAC). Their support must be included when referencing this project. 

About malaria
Malaria places a heavy burden on the health of children. With intensive global effort, it is estimated that 6.2 million deaths due to malaria were prevented between 2001 and 2015, 5.9 million (95%) of which were those of young children. However, malaria continues to take its toll. A child under 5 dies every 2 minutes from the disease.  

For information on the project and the disease go to the Severe Malaria Observatory (SMO). The SMO has been created to shine a light on severe malaria and is a repository of information about this fatal disease and is a knowledge based platform used by the malaria community to share experience and guidance on severe malaria.

About MAM and MAM at scale
In the MAM pilot project, once a suspected severe malaria case was identified in the community, RAS was administered and the child referred to a health facility, in many cases via bicycle ambulance. During the pilot phase, the project’s emergency transport scheme made 1,066 transfers to a health facility – with local volunteers riding bicycle ambulances placed strategically within local communities. Once at the health facility, the child could be administered WHO recommended first-line treatment for severe malaria injectable artesunate, followed by a course of artemisinin combination treatment (ACT) as soon they are able to take oral medication and after at least 24 hours of parenteral therapy.

Alongside funding from the Canadian Government, MAM at Scale is being made possible thanks to a consortium of partners – Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) provides technical malaria expertise and secured funds while Development Data and Transaid are implementing the project on the ground with partners, DAI Global Health (formally Health Partners International), Disacare, and District Health Management Team.
