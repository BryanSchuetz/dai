> “Like DAI, these companies are employee-owned and mission-driven. Coming together under the DAI banner will expand DAI’s service offering in the global health arena and augment our strengths in women’s and gender issues across the DAI portfolio. We look forward to bringing the benefits of Britain’s extraordinary health expertise to communities and markets all around the world.” **[Chris LeGrand](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/leadership/christopher-legrand), President of DAI Global Health.**

“Joining forces with a truly global development company like DAI affords us the organizational resources to scale up our work,” said Bryan Haddon, Chair of the HPI Board and founder of the company. “Most importantly, DAI shares our commitment to local partnership, technical excellence, and ethical integrity in all phases of its work.”

HPI has delivered more than 200 health projects in 40 countries over the past two decades, with an emphasis on strengthening domestic health systems—the most sustainable way of saving lives at scale. The firm is particularly strong in immunization, nutrition, malaria and other communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, and maternal, newborn, and child health.

“Our technical experts are excited by DAI’s vision of a tech-enabled, data-centric approach to global health challenges,” said Haddon.

Founded in 2000, WISE—originally an acronym for Women in Sustainable Economic Development—has won a global reputation for expertise in the areas that matter most to gender equality: economic empowerment, human rights, political leadership, and environmental resources.
