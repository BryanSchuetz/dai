DAI has been recognized by the [Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND)](https://pindfoundation.org/) with an award as part of the foundation's 10-year anniversary celebration of making a difference by reducing poverty, powering coastal communities, catalyzing youth employment, fostering stability, empowering local organizations and enabling development in the Niger Delta region. 

DAI, through the [Market Development in the Niger Delta (MADE) project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-market-development-programme-made), phases I and II, worked in all nine Niger Delta states to promote inclusive, pro-poor growth for farmers and entrepreneurs.

Under MADE I, DAI carried out a six-month design, followed by the first phase of implementation. MADE II scaled up successful market interventions from the first phase and established exit plans with local partners. The program also accelerated the outreach and outcomes from MADE I by doubling the results in half the time and half the budget. By connecting vulnerable populations with desirable jobs at home, MADE II reduced the number of Nigerians attempting to migrate to work abroad only to end up [trapped in modern slavery](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-market-driven-strategies-to-reduce-poverty-and-human-trafficking-in-nigeria).

The award was recently received by DAI Nigeria Country Director [Dr. Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah) for DAI’s partnership in reducing poverty through market linkages, jobs facilitation, and increasing incomes in the Niger Delta.
