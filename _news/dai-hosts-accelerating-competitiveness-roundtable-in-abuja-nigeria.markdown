Abuja, Nigeria—DAI yesterday hosted leaders from the Nigerian government and local business people for a roundtable on leveraging the country’s increased competitiveness for agricultural productivity and broad-based economic growth.

The country’s improved position stems from business-friendly reforms and a devalued and stabilized currency—which makes investing inside Nigeria more affordable and exporting more profitable.

“Nigeria has done a good job in recent years at chipping away at its bottlenecks for doing business; this resulted in [strong improvement](http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2018) to our World Bank rankings,” said DAI Country Director [Dr. Joe Abah](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joe-abah), who hosted the roundtable at the Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. “With this improvement, combined with our more affordable investment climate, there has never been a better time to initiate business development in Nigeria.”
