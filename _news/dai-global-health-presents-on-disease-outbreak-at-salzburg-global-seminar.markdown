Dr. [Andrew Kitua](https://www.facebook.com/DAIGlobal/videos/10156338078985797/), DAI Global Health’s Director for the East and Central Africa Region of the [Preparedness and Response (P&R)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr) project in Uganda, and [Robert Salerno](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/robert-salerno), DAI’s Technical Integration Manager for the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded P&R project, will participate in the [Salzburg Global Seminar](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/multi-year-series/general.html?pageId=8530) session ‘Finding Outbreaks Faster: How Do We Measure Progress?’ in Austria November 4–8.

The Salzburg programs facilitate discussion and dialogue between cross-sector development actors, with the aim of uniting expertise to tackle complex challenges. 

This session will focus on advancing a common framework for monitoring progress towards pandemic preparedness to meet the goals of the Global Health Security Agenda and comply with International Health Regulations. Anticipated participants include field epidemiologists, such as Kitua, government officials, and nongovernmental organization leaders amongst others. 

The [P&R](http://preparednessandresponse.org/) team helped design and implement national plans for how to respond to public health events and unknown diseases across 15 countries globally, and has also worked to establish and strengthen National One Health Platforms.
