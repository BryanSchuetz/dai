The economy of the West Bank and Gaza moved up 26 places in the World Bank Doing Business report for 2018, from 140th to 114th in the annual ranking of 190 economies. The West Bank and Gaza’s overall score—an average of 10 indicators that measure ease of doing business—increased from 54.88 to 58.68 under the “Distance to Frontier” 1–100 scale—the ninth-largest year-over-year improvement among the 190 economies. The West Bank and Gaza upgrade was led by significant improvements made under the “Getting Credit” indicator.

For “Getting Credit,” the West Bank and Gaza moved up from 118th to 20th place, the greatest improvement in this indicator. The World Bank noted that the West Bank and Gaza strengthened access to credit by introducing a Law for Secured Transactions and by setting up a new collateral registry for movable assets. The new law implemented a secured transactions system that allowedimproved and more functional descriptions of assets, debts, and obligations. The collateral registry is now operational, unified geographically, and searchable by a debtor’s unique identifier. The new law gave priority to secured creditors outside insolvency procedures and now allows out-of-court restructuring as a debt-enforcement option.

Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and the European Commission and implemented by DAI, the Palestinian Market Development Programme (PMDP) assisted the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy in its efforts to improve West Bank and Gaza’s Doing Business ranking.

The PMDP team supported the ministry in analyzing West Bank and Gaza’s status in each of the 10 indicators and identifying potential areas for reform. This effort produced a comprehensive action plan that identified short-, medium- and long-term reforms needed to improve Palestine’s ranking. The action plan was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers and adopted by a ministerial committee formed to follow up on the action plan. Specific technical committees were also established to pursue advancement of proposed reforms. 

For the “Getting Credit” indicator, PMDP’s team supported the ministry by ensuring that the legal framework for the Law for Secured Transactions was complete and the establishment of the collateral registry was fully functional. Most notably, PMDP met with the financial sector to raise awareness and promote the use of the registry, which was essential in recognizing the reform. 
PMDP is now collaborating with the World Bank to advance additional reforms in the West Bank and Gaza in areas such as business licensing and construction permits to improve future rankings.
