DAI is delighted to announce that it has been named Prime Partner of the Year by the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce (MCCC). The award is designed "to recognize a prime contractor who demonstrates excellence in sub-contracting and support to small businesses to accelerate their success." Past winners include Northrup Grumman, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Lockheed Martin.

"International development is always a collaborative enterprise, whether that collaboration takes place in the field or right here in Maryland," said DAI President and CEO [Jim Boomgard][1]. "We value our partners—especially our small business partners—for their insights, their industry, and their innovation, and we work hard with them to build working relationships based on mutual respect. We're grateful to see these efforts recognized by the Chamber."

Boomgard will accept the award at the MCCC's Business Awards Dinner on November 17 at the Bethesda North Marriott Hotel and County Conference Center, an annual event that attracts upwards of 800 leaders from business and from federal, state, and regional governments.

In making the award, the MCCC noted how DAI has provided "dedicated service to our National Center for Veteran Institute for Procurement (VIP) and MCCC Government Contracting Network (GovConNet) and by all measure has gone above and beyond the call of duty to support these missions." DAI supported VIP with curriculum development and served on the Steering Committee of GovConNet's annual Procurement Conference, in addition to developing and hosting breakout and matchmaking sessions.

"The success of MCCC's GovConNet and Veteran Institute for Procurement is reliant on strong and dedicated partners," said MCCC Executive VP and VIP National Director Barbara Ashe. "DAI is the gold standard of a Prime Partner and is most deserving of this recognition."

DAI has a long-standing commitment to the small business community. The company holds [small business matchmaking fairs][3] at its Bethesda office, and was one of the first U.S. Agency for International Development implementing partners to participate formally in the Agency's Mentor-Protégé Program, [serving as a mentor][4] to The CloudBurst Group.

This year, DAI partnered with Montgomery County on an Innovation into Action Challenge to identify and support small businesses and nongovernmental organizations with the potential to make a difference in developing nations. In May, the Challenge brought together nine finalists—from 296 entrants—and selected four winners, each of which is now working with DAI in field locations to test and develop their innovations.

The MCCC's Prime Partner of the Year Award comes on the heels of a similar award from the U.K. Department for International Development, which recently recognized DAI for its [excellent relationships with subcontractors][5].
