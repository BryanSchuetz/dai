The Polish Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (PolSEFF), implemented by DAI and funded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), recently held its first awards ceremony to recognize Polish small and medium enterprises' achievements in raising energy efficiency standards.

More than 100 guests—including representatives from small and medium firms, bankers, ministers, senior management from EBRD, and local business media—attended the gala dinner and awards ceremony organized by the DAI project team.

The small and medium firms that have most wisely used PolSEFF investments were presented with awards, and videos were shown of their work. PolSEFF partner banks were also recognized for their contributions

[PolSEFF][1] was launched by the EBRD in 2011 as part of its multinational SEFF program implemented throughout Central and Eastern Europe. PolSEFF's ultimate goal is to incentivize Polish firms to replace old technology with cleaner, more efficient technology or to start small renewable energy projects. Up to 15 percent of the loan is paid back to the firm upon completing a successful project.

DAI provides PolSEFF with management, banking, and marketing expertise to promote and facilitate loans to firms each month from five major Polish banks and leasing companies. DAI works with local and international engineers to assess the benefits of the firms' proposed energy-efficient projects.
