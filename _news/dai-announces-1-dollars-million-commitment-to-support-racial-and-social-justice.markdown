DAI condemns the murder of George Floyd, stands alongside the black community and all those who resist injustice, and avows that Black Lives Matter. And although words are important at this critical moment, we know that we must express this solidarity in actions as well as words.

In response to recent incidents that reflect deep-seated injustice in the United States, but with an eye to advance social justice concerns and combat systematic racism on a wider stage, DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard this week announced a corporate commitment to support social justice and racial equity initiatives both inside the firm and in the countries where DAI lives and works. 

The company will invest $1 million in the effort.

> “The killing of George Floyd is the immediate occasion for [taking on] this challenge,” wrote Boomgard in a June 2 email to DAI staff. “But as the global reaction to his death makes clear, injustice, impunity, and inhumanity strike a visceral chord around the world, and in our response we will strive to support the enduring global values of justice, accountability, and humanity.”
