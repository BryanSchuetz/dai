At least nine DAI-led projects and several technical experts are participating in the [26th Conference of the Parties (COP)](https://ukcop26.org/the-conference/presidency-programme/) convention in Glasgow, running through November 12. COP is the decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and this convention is the overarching international agreement on taking action to address climate change. 

“We are presenting the work that we are doing in mitigating climate change, and helping vulnerable countries and communities adapt to a changing climate,” said [Donald Lunan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/donald-lunan), DAI’s Global Director for Climate. “We will have a varied presence across Glasgow throughout the two weeks, ensuring that voices are heard from our projects on the impacts of climate change, and the importance of urgent [action](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-race-to-zero-campaign-accelerating-companys-trajectory-to-net-zero).”

The following projects and experts are presenting: 

* The [Acting for Climate in South Mediterranean (Clima-Med)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-eu-for-climate-action-in-the-european-neighbourhood-instrument-eni-southern-neighbourhood) project, funded by the European Union (EU), works to enhance the energy security and adaptive capacity of the partner countries, leading to more stable, efficient, competitive, and climate-resilient socio-economic contexts, while increasing energy sovereignty and reducing emissions. Clima Med works in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. In Glasgow, the team is presenting a hybrid event with the Union for the Mediterranean and Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development, and Environment of Cyprus on Climate action in the Mediterranean. 
* The EU-funded [Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/asia-global-covenant-of-mayors-for-climate-gcom-and-energy) project works to strengthen the role of cities on the wider international scene and provide operational tools for effective climate action. Regional and national covenants serve as local chapters of the broader GCoM alliance. Our team supports the GCoM in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, assisting signatory cities and partners in their commitments while encouraging new cities and urban stakeholders to join the GCoM alliance in pursuit of a shared vision for a resilient and low-emission future. On November 9, GCoM will be presented with the [Gulbenkian Foundation’s Prize for Humanity](https://gulbenkian.pt/en/the-foundation/gulbenkian-prize-for-humanity/), first won last year by Greta Thunberg. Additionally, project representatives will participate in two panels—“Localising the NDCs” and “Racing to 1.5°.”  
* The Social Protection Technical Assistance Facility (SPTAF) provides demand-driven services to the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), national governments, and partners in gender-responsive social protection and social protection approaches in crises. On November 8, the team is coordinating the FCDO’s Social Protection Team panel, “Protecting the hardest hit: the critical role of gender equality and social protection.” 
* The FCDO-funded [Centre for Disaster Protection (CDP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-centre-for-disaster-protection) manages risks relating to disasters, helping countries move from reaction to readiness and plan better for future disasters. The Centre works with country governments, development banks, humanitarian agencies, development insurers, private sector actors, research institutions, and nongovernmental groups.
At COP26, CDP is hosting a World Food Programme Partnership Dinner, participating in a Department of International Trade Showcase, and partnering with DAI for DEVEX’s online panel, “[COP Out? Can vulnerable countries ever truly adapt to climate change without the international system radically changing how it pays for disasters?](https://pages.devex.com/cop-out-or-radically-change-the-way-the-world-pays-for-disasters.html)” 
* The EU-funded [Determination of Industrial Emissions Strategy of Turkey in Accordance with Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/turkey-determination-of-industrial-emissions-strategy-of-turkey-in-accordance-with-integrated-pollution-prevention-and-control) project supports Turkey in establishing industrial pollution prevention and control approaches, according to the Industrial Emissions Directive, as well as to build institutional and technical capacity while raising awareness concerning air pollution. The team is facilitating several sessions within the Turkey Pavilion in Glasgow, focusing on industrial emissions and contributions to climate neutrality, the European Green Deal, and low-carbon development. 
* The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [INVEST](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-the-invest-project) project provides support for investment assessments, structuring funds, and transaction advisory services. The team has recently published a learning brief, “[Catalyzing Private Finance for Climate Action](https://www.usaid.gov/documents/catalyzing-private-finance-climate-action-learning-brief).” INVEST’s [Robin Young ](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/robin-young) will be part of a [Devex event](https://pages.devex.com/future-of-development-finance-2021.html#register), along with [Katja Silva-Leander](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/katja-silva-leander), Director of Development Finance and Investment. 
* The USAID-funded [Peru PREVENT](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/peru-prevent) project aims to sustainably transform the culture of rule of law and citizen stewardship when it comes to protecting Peru’s environmental assets. The PREVENT team has facilitated a Devex interview with indigenous leader Walter Quertehuari, President of the Reserva Comunal Amarakaeri, about the importance of local leadership in biodiversity conservation and ensuring that indigenous voices are heard at COP26.
* The global sustainable development partnership, [SEED](https://www.seed.uno/), will introduce two panel discussions on [Entrepreneurship for Climate Mitigation and Resilience](https://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/sites/default/files/ICC-COP26_%20SEED-Concept%20Note_Agenda_Final.pdf) to highlight the relevance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and their contributions to advance net zero and the 2030 Agenda. [Bhairav Raja](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bhairav-raja), Senior Manager within DAI’s Sustainable Business Group, will present on private sector engagement in small-scale enterprises and innovative tools to access finance that supports climate mitigation.
* The USAID-funded [Ukraine Economic Resilience Activity (ERA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-economic-resilience-activity) empowers eastern Ukrainians to establish and develop SMEs to innovate and enter new markets in Ukraine, the European Union, and elsewhere. ERA will be represented at the COP26 Conference by Artem Vivdych, ERA's Transformation Component Manager, as well as several partners and beneficiaries.
