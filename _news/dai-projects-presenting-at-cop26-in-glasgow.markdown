At least 10 DAI-led projects and several technical experts are participating in the [26th Conference of the Parties (COP)](https://ukcop26.org/the-conference/presidency-programme/) convention in Glasgow, running through November 12. COP is the decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and this convention is the overarching international agreement on taking action to address climate change. 

“We are presenting the work that we are doing in mitigating climate change, and helping vulnerable countries and communities adapt to a changing climate,” said [Donald Lunan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/donald-lunan), DAI’s Global Director for Climate. “We will have a varied presence across Glasgow throughout the two weeks, ensuring that voices are heard from our projects on the impacts of climate change, and the importance of urgent [action](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-race-to-zero-campaign-accelerating-companys-trajectory-to-net-zero).”

The following projects and experts are presenting: 

* The [Acting for Climate in South Mediterranean (Clima-Med)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-eu-for-climate-action-in-the-european-neighbourhood-instrument-eni-southern-neighbourhood) project, funded by the European Union (EU), works to enhance the energy security and adaptive capacity of the partner countries, leading to more stable, efficient, competitive, and climate-resilient socio-economic contexts, while increasing energy sovereignty and reducing emissions. Clima Med works in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia. In Glasgow, on November 2, the team is presenting a [hybrid event on climate action](https://www.climamed.eu/cop26-clima-med-will-demonstrate-innovative-funding-models-mainstreaming-climate-action-in-the-south-mediterranean-region/) in the Mediterranean with the [Union for the Mediterranean](https://ufmsecretariat.org/); the [Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development, and Environment](https://moa.gov.cy/ministry/mission/?lang=en) of Cyprus; and the [Network of Mediterranean Experts on Climate and Environmental Change](https://www.medecc.org/).
* On November 9, Clima-Med will also participate in “[Racing to 1.5°: cities mainstreaming evidence-based climate & energy policies in Europe & Mediterranean](https://cop26eusideevents.app.swapcard.com/event/eu-side-events-cop26/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNzI1NTA0).” Cities and regions, members of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, and local government representatives will reflect on their evidence-based, climate and energy plans, and demonstrate impact-driven success stories. Co-organizers of the event are the European Commission, the Covenant of Mayors–Europe, and the Joint Research Centre. Clima-Med will be [showcased at the event](https://www.climamed.eu/cop26-how-are-cities-in-europe-and-the-mediterranean-implementing-evidence-based-climate-energy-action/) as one of the leading EU-funded climate action initiatives in the Mediterranean.
* Also on November 9, the EU-funded [Support the Secretariat of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/support-the-secretariat-of-the-global-covenant-of-mayors-for-climate-and-energy) will participate in the EU side event at which the [Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy](https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/) will be awarded the [Gulbenkian Foundation’s Prize for Humanity](https://gulbenkian.pt/en/the-foundation/gulbenkian-prize-for-humanity/), first won last year by Greta Thunberg. Regional and national covenants serve as local chapters of the broader Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy alliance. The DAI-led project facilitates coordination mechanisms between the regional and the global covenants to improve coherence between their activities. Our technical assistance supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals. 
* The Social Protection Technical Assistance Facility (SPTAF) provides demand-driven services to the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), national governments, and partners in gender-responsive social protection and social protection approaches in crises. On November 8, the team is coordinating the FCDO’s Social Protection Team panel, “Protecting the hardest hit: the critical role of gender equality and social protection.” 
* The FCDO-funded [Centre for Disaster Protection (CDP)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-centre-for-disaster-protection) manages risks relating to disasters, helping countries move from reaction to readiness and plan better for future disasters. The Centre works with country governments, development banks, humanitarian agencies, development insurers, private sector actors, research institutions, and nongovernmental groups. At COP26, CDP is hosting a World Food Programme Partnership Dinner, participating in a Department of International Trade Showcase, and partnering with DAI for DEVEX’s online panel, “[COP Out? Can vulnerable countries ever truly adapt to climate change without the international system radically changing how it pays for disasters?](https://pages.devex.com/cop-out-or-radically-change-the-way-the-world-pays-for-disasters.html)” 
* DAI development specialists and project consultants are facilitating several sessions within the Türkiye Pavilion in Glasgow, focusing on the evolution of European legislation on industrial emissions and contribution to climate neutrality objective, energy and circular economy policies, the EU Green Deal, and low-carbon development. 
* The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [INVEST](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-the-invest-project) project provides support for investment assessments, structuring funds, and transaction advisory services. The team has recently published a learning brief, “[Catalyzing Private Finance for Climate Action](https://www.usaid.gov/documents/catalyzing-private-finance-climate-action-learning-brief).” INVEST’s [Robin Young ](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/robin-young) will be part of a [Devex event](https://pages.devex.com/future-of-development-finance-2021.html#register), along with [Katja Silva-Leander](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/katja-silva-leander), Director of Development Finance and Investment. 
* The USAID-funded [Peru PREVENT](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/peru-prevent) project aims to sustainably transform the culture of rule of law and citizen stewardship when it comes to protecting Peru’s environmental assets. The PREVENT team has facilitated a Devex interview with indigenous leader Walter Quertehuari, President of the Reserva Comunal Amarakaeri, about the importance of local leadership in biodiversity conservation and ensuring that indigenous voices are heard at COP26.
* The global sustainable development partnership, [SEED](https://www.seed.uno/), will introduce two panel discussions on [Entrepreneurship for Climate Mitigation and Resilience](https://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/sites/default/files/ICC-COP26_%20SEED-Concept%20Note_Agenda_Final.pdf) to highlight the relevance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and their contributions to advance net zero and the 2030 Agenda. [Bhairav Raja](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bhairav-raja), Senior Manager within DAI’s Sustainable Business Group, will present on private sector engagement in small-scale enterprises and innovative tools to access finance that supports climate mitigation.
* The USAID-funded [Ukraine Economic Resilience Activity (ERA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-economic-resilience-activity) empowers eastern Ukrainians to establish and develop SMEs to innovate and enter new markets in Ukraine, the European Union, and elsewhere. ERA will be represented at the COP26 Conference by Artem Vivdych, ERA's Transformation Component Manager, as well as several partners and beneficiaries.
* The FCDO-funded [Nepal Renewable Energy Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nepal-renewable-energy-programme) is sponsoring three delegates to COP26 and will be co-sponsoring the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre’s 25th Anniversary through a Renewable Energy Workshop.
