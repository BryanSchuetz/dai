More than 1,200 people representing local businesses attended the Liza Phase I Supplier Development Forum December 3–4 at the Marriott Hotel in Georgetown, Guyana. Hosted by the [Centre for Local Business Development](https://clbdguyana.com/) and ExxonMobil, the forum discussed the scopes of work of prime contractors and provided 2019 procurement opportunities. ExxonMobil and its prime contractors are currently building infrastructure to support a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel with first oil expected in early 2020.

The forum provided an opportunity for Guyanese suppliers to ask questions and get information directly from ExxonMobil and its prime contractors. The December 3 activities—attended by more than 190 companies and 300 guests—featured remarks from the ExxonMobil Guyana country manager and prime contractors, as well as panels moderated by DAI’s [Dorival Bettencourt](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/dorival-bettencourt) and Zachary Kaplan. The December 4 business expo—which attracted 1,200 participants representing 570 businesses—enabled Guyanese suppliers to pitch their goods and services to Exxon and its contractors. To help prepare the businesses for the event, DAI’s [Zaki Raheem](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/zaki-raheem) and [Christina Aguila](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/christina-aguila) since September have been leading “pitch courses” at the Centre.

ExxonMobil Guyana has prioritized using local suppliers for its operations. The company sponsors the Local Business Development Centre in Georgetown to assist Guyanese businesses to become more competitive, earn more business, and create jobs as a result of increasing demand for goods and services both by ExxonMobil and the Guyanese economy. The Centre is operated by DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business).
