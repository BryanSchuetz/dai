The Spring 2013 issue of _Developments_ is now available.

In the cover story, Sydney Zharare describes how we used a Making Markets Work for the Poor approach [in Mozambique][1] to broker a mutually profitable and hence sustainable partnership between a major poultry operation and struggling local farmers.

Feature articles include the following:

* Heidi Silvey describes DAI's role in bringing a development perspective to the Department of Defense's strategic exercises regarding emerging, unconventional threats.
* David Sardi writes of how civilians and military members are [working together][2] in West Africa to share information and increase security for citizens, especially those living in outlying areas.
* [Colleen Green][3] of the [IMARISHA][4] project describes her team's survey of HIV/AIDS-affected households in Tanzania and how it is shaping assistance provided by DAI and partner organizations to those households and communities.
* [Larry Campbell][5] relates how DAI is teaming up with India-based eSeal to develop a mobile platform from which farmers and agribusinesses can obtain precious business information cheaply or for free.
* DAI's Jim Seyler celebrates the Rwandan national park [project][6] honored by British travel writers as the world's best.
* Elizabeth Drachman looks back on an [enterprise strengthening project][7] that reached more than 1 million Cambodians by tapping into that country's existing know-how.

In the [DAIdeas][8] piece that accompanies every issue of Developments, [Bill Grant][9] and [Zach Kaplan][10] explore Chevron's new paradigm for corporate social involvement in the Niger Delta.

Finally, in the executive opinion section, Senior Vice President, International Julian Lob-Levyt reflects on the increasingly high expectations development organizations and donors must meet if they are to keep pace with the rapidly transforming development landscape.
