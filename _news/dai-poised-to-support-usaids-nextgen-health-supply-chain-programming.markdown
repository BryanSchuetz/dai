An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, the Comprehensive TA IDIQ is part of the Agency’s broader Next Generation Global Health Supply Chain Suite of Programs (NextGen). 

“We are thrilled to be among USAID’s NextGen partners in the critical work of health supply chain strengthening,” said [Sarah Helmstadter](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/leadership/sarah-helmstadter), Senior Vice President of DAI’s U.S. Government Business. “This opportunity builds on our experience supporting USAID to strengthen local stewardship, accountability, and innovation across health supply chains. Our consortium brings together a wide range of expertise providing technical assistance to ensure medicines, health products, and related commodities reach patients through efficient and effective local systems, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes.”

Over the next 10 years, USAID’s implementing partners on the Comprehensive TA program will work with host-country counterparts to:

* **Strengthen local supply chain systems** to ensure a reliable supply of high-quality health commodities, through public and private sector channels, in ways that encourage the long-term sustainability of those supply chains; 
* **Increase the availability of quality-assured, essential health commodities**, through improved supply chain performance; and
* **Improve pharmaceutical management systems**, including the development of high-quality pharmaceutical services and well-functioning regulatory systems. 

DAI’s consortium for the Comprehensive TA IDIQ consists of major subcontractor Crown Agents and nine other distinguished partners: ClickMedix; Crowley Government Services; Dalberg Consulting U.S.; EnCompass; Freight in Time; Medication Outcomes Center, School of Pharmacy and the Institute of Global Health Sciences, University of California San Francisco; Axia Institute at Michigan State University; Pamela Steele Associates; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Carolina Population Center; and VillageReach.
