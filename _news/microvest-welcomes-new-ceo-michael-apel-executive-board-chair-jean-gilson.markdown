"I have had the privilege of knowing Michael for three decades,” said MicroVest co-founder [Gil Crawford](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/gil-crawford), who remains a member of the MicroVest Board and will continue to Chair the firm’s Investment Committee. “He is someone who operates with a values-driven mindset, humility, and a deep appreciation for the communities impacted by his investments.
