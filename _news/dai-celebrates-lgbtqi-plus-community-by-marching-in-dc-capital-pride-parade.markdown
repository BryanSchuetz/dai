On Saturday, June 10, nearly 100 DAI staff, family, and friends participated in the Washington, D.C. Capital Pride Parade—the largest celebration of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the U.S. capital. Led by DAI Pride, DAI’s LGBTQI\+ employee resource group, DAI staff marched through DuPont Circle neighborhood outfitted in DAI Pride t-shirts, hats, and flags.

"It was a blast to march with my colleagues and their loved ones at the Pride Parade,” said Tine Knott, Senior Vice President for DAI’s U.S. Government Business. "Pride is embedded in our values as a company. I’m proud of the decisions we’ve taken over the years to make DAI a welcoming place for people of all genders and sexual orientations, and I’m proud of the energy our employee resource group, DAI Pride, is bringing to this longstanding DAI commitment." 

DAI is addressing LGBTQI\+ issues in its projects as well as in its corporate practices. In Colombia, for example, the [Responsive Governance (RG) Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/colombia-responsive-governance-rg-activity) is working with local partners to improve access to high-quality health care for the LGBTQI\+ community, while in Honduras the [Honduras Local Governance Activity](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/colombia-responsive-governance-rg-activity) collaborates with LGBTQI\+ civil society organizations to enhance their advocacy efforts and civic participation.
