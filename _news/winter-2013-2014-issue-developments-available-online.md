Leading off, development practitioner [Zaki Raheem][1] describes how hundreds of entrepreneurs in Somaliland answered a call for business plans with proposals to fill major gaps in the economy. Many are now implementing their ideas with help from matching grants from the [Partnership Fund][2], part of the U.S. Agency for International Development project, Partnership for Economic Growth, being implemented by DAI.

Other stories include:

* [Saad Hamid][3], a communications specialist working in Pakistan, writes about how marginalized boys and girls across the country are now going to school by the thousands thanks to the [innovative efforts][4] of scores of local education champions, partially funded by a U.K. Department for International Development program.
* Even though water is scarce in Morocco, farmers are demonstrating how they now earn more money while actually using less water on their crops. [Andrew Watson][5], DAI's Managing Director for Environment and Health, tells the [story][6].
* At first glance, natural resource conservation has little to do with [electronic hotel reservations][7]. Practitioners Lia Grigg and [Miguel Baca][8] write about a Honduran entrepreneur who helped marry the two ideas for the benefit of both local hotel operators and protected areas.
* Fiscal reform means more than helping countries develop sound and accountable systems and policies; it can also mean assisting Jordan to issue a $1.25 billion bond, saving the country millions of dollars that it can now use locally. _Developments_ Editor Charles Coon writes about it [here][9].
* What does a poor country do when it strikes it rich through discoveries of natural gas? [Zachary Kaplan][10], DAI's resident expert in public-private partnerships, [recommends][11] next steps toward a "local content" policy in Mozambique that could benefit communities across the country while improving the business environment for the extractives companies.
* In the Philippines, the Pulilan Local Government recently went [cash-light][12], launching an electronic payroll system by which its 300 employees receive their salaries digitally. As a result, [John Jepsen][13] and Mamerto Tangonan write, more than 10,000 Pulilan households can now pay their utility bills via their mobile phones, a cheaper and less risky way to transfer money.
* Finally, in the executive opinion section, [Del McCluskey][14], DAI's Global Practice Leader for Environment, Climate Change, and Urban Services, proposes a way for the Philippines to [build back better][15] after the horrific typhoon Haiyan, a road map that might also serve other nations vulnerable to catastrophic weather.
