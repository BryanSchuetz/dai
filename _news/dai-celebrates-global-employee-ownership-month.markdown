DAI celebrated Global Employee Ownership (GEO) Month in October. Events included the annual shareholders meeting, a GEO orientation for new employees, and socials in both our U.S. and U.K. offices. 

DAI has always been employee-owned. But until February 2016, ownership was limited to U.S.-based employees via its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). As we expanded our global footprint, we created a new ownership structure that accommodates this increasingly global workforce. In the new, more inclusive framework, the ESOP is complemented by an active ownership option available to all global corporate employees. 

DAI’s employee ownership program has been recognized with awards from both the [Global Equity Organization](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-employee-ownership-initiative-wins-prestigious-award) and the [National Center for Employee Ownership](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-wins-innovations-in-employee-ownership-award-for-2017). 

“Employee ownership is an essential part of DAI’s culture and brand,” said [Joy White](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/joy-white), GEO Director. “In fact, it is a key component of our value proposition as an employer. Global employee ownership helps motivate, incentivize, and focus employees on company growth, performance, and success.”
