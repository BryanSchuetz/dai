DAI is delighted to announce that an internal unit has been appraised at [CMMI Maturity Level 3](https://sas.cmmiinstitute.com/pars/pars.aspx). Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a capability improvement framework that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes that ultimately improve their performance. Dr. Richard Bechtold of Abridge Technology led the appraisal.

In DAI’s case, a unit called Stabilization, Transition, and Technology was rated at Maturity Level 3. There are five levels of CMMI; Maturity Level 3 means “processes are well characterized and understood, and are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods.”
