The Fall 2015 issue of DAI's *Developments* newsletter is now available [online][1].

Leading off, Mathilde Gaston-Mathé and Emmanuel Moyart describe how the African, Caribbean, and Pacific/European Union Microfinance Programme [vitalized a network][2] of practitioners and stakeholders—including more than 2,400 microfinance institutions, 3,000 staff, and 57 policy makers—across 32 countries.

Next up, Kate Heuisler and Hank Nelson write about how the U.S. Agency for International Development's Development Innovations program [answered a need][3] in Cambodia for basic video training, which was almost nonexistent, empowering young Cambodians working in that country's civil society sector to tell their stories more effectively.

Other articles include:

* How the Palestine Market Development Programme launched a quick-response grants program in post-conflict Gaza to help 127 businesses [get back up and running][4], by Mira Nasser.
* Alexander Kitain's article about the Philippines' [upsurge in the e-filing of taxes][5], making compliance easier for taxpayers and businesses and tax-collecting more efficient for the government.
* Shannon Dugan and Paul Hartman telling of how communities across the ecologically sensitive Lower Mekong region are [combining climate science with local realities][6] in developing plans to adapt to climate change.
* Marjan Jukić describing the Provincial Governance Index, which the USAID Sapan Program in Thailand developed to [measure how citizens feel][7] about the jobs their provisional governments are doing.
