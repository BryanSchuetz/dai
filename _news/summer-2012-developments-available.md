The Summer 2012 issue_ _of_ Developments_ is now available.

In the cover story, Ed Rackley relates the ups and downs of engaging youth and especially youth music to hold [government accountable][1] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Chuck Coon [tells the story][2] of the Vietnam Support for Trade Acceleration and Reform project, an initiative that, in the words of its independent evaluation, "pushed the envelope of what technical assistance can accomplish."

Sagay Moodliar describes how DAI's Johannesburg-based team is helping South African mining giant [Sishen Iron Ore Co.][3] design and implement a community development trust that will boost incomes and improve living conditions for more than 300,000 residents of the communities in which it works.

[Walter Weaver][4] looks back on the [achievements][5] of the award-winning Instituting Water Demand Management (IDARA) project in Jordan.

Geospatial analyst [Carmen Tedesco][6] celebrates the "south-south" [collaboration][7] that is flourishing on the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) interactive website for natural resource management communities, [FRAMEWeb][8].

Four of the articles in this issue spring from the development program in Afghanistan:

* Trade economist David Fischer makes the case for a "[Herat economic corridor][9]" that could catalyze the economy in western Afghanistan and make the city of Herat "an outward-looking regional industrial trade hub."
* Dana Kenney, Matiullah Amanzai, and Said Noor Ahmad Sadat distill the lessons learned from the implementation of [microhydro power plants][10], some 160 of which have been installed in recent years to bring life-changing electric power to remote Afghan villages.
* Anne Simmons-Benton, Jessica Heinzelman, and Jill Sackett outline their recommendations for restoring [Afghan women][11] to a place of opportunity in the national economy.
* And in the [DAI_deas_][12] piece that accompanies every issue of _Developments_, [Juan Estrada-Valle ][13]describes the innovations in Islamic finance and credit administration that have enabled USAID's [Agricultural Credit Enhancement][14] program to make impressive headway in an environment far from conducive to lending—facilitating new borrowing for 15,000 rural households.

Finally, in the executive opinion section, our Managing Director in our South Africa office, Claudia Manning, argues for a commitment to authentic local supplier development that goes beyond compliance with the nation's black economic empowerment scorecards.
