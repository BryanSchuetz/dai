DAI's [Land Tenure and Property Rights][1] team will make two presentations—one looking at the emerging trends and recent initiatives for improving land tenure in Africa and the second looking at how the Mozambican private sector, international investors, and donors are working to introduce more flexibility into land rights transfers—at the Annual [World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty][2] 2015, on March 23–27.

The team will also be presenting our low-cost participatory approach to land titling that's been employed on two large-scale national programmes at the Innovations Fair, a new feature added to the Conference this year. The Innovations Fair, to be held on March 26, is a full day focusing on solutions for land administration and management. The Innovations Fair will encourage hands-on interaction with conference participants looking for solutions to the land challenges of the post-2015 Development Agenda.

"The impact of large-scale titling can be a very significant step in the achievement of security of tenure and must consider customary as well as formal rights," said [Richard Baldwin][4], DAI's Global Practice Lead for Land Tenure and Property Rights. "Where these programmes are successful, it is done with extensive local participation and must be balanced with the wider sector reforms, where lasting solutions can be more difficult to achieve. While titling is only part of the solution, the approach and methodology developed and implemented by DAI in [Rwanda][5] and now being applied in [Ethiopia][6], has enabled large programmes to be completed in relatively short periods.

"The challenge now is to ensure that the necessary associated reforms are in place to support land-related transactions. At the Innovations Fair, our team will explain how these programmes can be implemented, what steps are involved in the wider reform, and what the impact and benefits are," he said.
