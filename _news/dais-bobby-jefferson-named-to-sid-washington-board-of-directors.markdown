The Society for International Development-Washington, D.C. Chapter has named DAI Vice President [Bobby Jefferso](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/bobby-jefferson)n to its Board of Directors. Jefferson is DAI’s lead development technologist and serves as Chief Technology Officer for DAI Global Health.

“SID-Washington is a respected convening force across all sectors of the development community and I am delighted to continue DAI’s long tradition of support as the Chapter charts its course for the upcoming decade,” said Jefferson. “As an expert in digital health, I hope I can bring that expertise to the organization; as a Black American, I hope I can bring some of my personal insights to what I’m sure will be a renewed emphasis on racial and other equity issues in the coming years.”

Jefferson sits on the Steering Committee for DAI’s recently announced [Racial and Social Justice Initiative](https://www.dai.com/news/an-anti-racist-company-ceo-jim-boomgard-lays-out-vision-for-dais-racial-and-social-justice-initiative).

“Bobby is an asset in any leadership team,” said DAI Senior Vice President for Strategy Jean Gilson, a long-time SID-Washington Board member who currently serves as [SID-International’s liaison](https://www.sidint.net/content/sid-welcomes-jean-gilson-new-vice-president) to the D.C. Chapter. “He’s uncompromising but pragmatic, sees the big picture but focuses on how we can bring our ideals and objectives to life in the real world.”

Jefferson serves as a board advisor for numerous enterprises, including the health technology startups THINKMD, ClickMedix, CodePartners, DataElevates, Covelocity.Health, and SimPrints. At DAI, he has taken a particular interest in sourcing, evaluating, and implementing technology startup investment opportunities.

“I am absolutely delighted to welcome Bobby to the SID-Washington Board,” said incoming Board Chair Wade Warren, Deloitte Consulting’s Chief Strategy Officer for International Development. “We have many challenges before us, not the least of which is the imperative to promote diversity and inclusion in development. I’m confident that Bobby will help us rise to these challenges and seize the opportunities in them.”
