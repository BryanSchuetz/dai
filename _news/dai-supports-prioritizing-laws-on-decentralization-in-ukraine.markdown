Decentralization in Ukraine has embraced the idea that a complex array of activities, policies, and procedures are needed to bolster the reorganization of financial, political, administrative, and service delivery systems. Most critically, Ukraine also understands that decentralization needs to be addressed in law.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [Governance and Local Accountability (HOVERLA)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ukraine-governance-and-local-accountability-hoverla) project continues the U.S. Government’s consistent support to this vision and journey. On January 31, with the support of USAID HOVERLA, the government and representatives met in a historic forum to set the legislative agenda for 2022. 

In his opening remarks, Marc Ellingstad, the Director of the Office of Democracy and Governance at USAID, emphasized that HOVERLA is designed to support the complexly interwoven web of legislative reform, local government strengthening, and citizen engagement activities. “The U.S. Agency for International Development through HOVERLA supports Ukraine’s decentralization," he said. "This forum represents a very significant milestone in Ukraine history. Decentralization is about strengthening local governments, and more than that, giving the people access to their governments. This forum represents just that, the mayors as representatives of their communities have prioritized the laws that need to be addressed in the spring session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for the mayors and their community governments to fulfill their mandate.”

Since 2014, the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of Ukraine has been working on a myriad of laws that will shape decentralization and deconcentration of sectoral services. These laws will also pave the way for private sector participation, regional development, accessibility, political stability, trust, and service delivery. However, what distinguishes the 2022 spring and fall session is that now they prioritize the laws in conformance to the expressed wishes of their citizenry represented by their mayors. The forum acknowledges that the mayors, local government associations as advocates are best able to bridge between central and local governments.
Prior to the Forum, HOVERLA conducted a survey among local communities and identified the following priorities for legislative revisions in the calendar year 2022:
1)	Consolidation of decentralization at the constitutional level through amendments to the Constitution in terms of decentralization
2)	Establishing a clear division of powers between local governments at different levels 
3)	Strengthening the financial base of local self-government by increasing the share of PIT contributions to local budgets
4)	Avoidance of duplication of powers between local governments and executive bodies by their legislative separation
5)	Improving the mechanisms for paying personal income tax to balance the interests of communities that attract investors and communities that provide services to citizens at the place of residence, i.e., the implementation of fair payment of this tax in the distribution between place of work and place of residence
6)	Develop, adopt, and implement a law on service in local self-government bodies that meets European standards
7)	Adopt and implement the law on local state administrations
8)	Institutionalize a new tool for citizen participation in community governance through the adoption and implementation of the law on local referendums
9)	Replace the Soviet principles of establishing and changing the administrative-territorial structure as the territorial and spatial basis of local government
10)	Eliminate the shortcomings of the current legislation on communal property
These priorities were presented to the representatives of the Verkhovna Rada at the Forum as a direct and structured voice of the communities. The historic significance of this event cannot be underestimated as it represents a first in Ukraine’s history. The forum represents a mechanism and a moment when the government becomes accessible to the people. In coming years HOVERLA will make this an annual event which can lead to the institutionalization of the practice of prioritizing laws in the open.
Recognizing that centralized institutions need to also find a balance between providing the crucial functions and supporting nascent local government institutions, Mr. Kornienko stated that “To be included.”

Ultimately, the forum demonstrated that Ukraine’s has the ability to meet several conditions for true and meaningful transfer of authorities to local government because 1) it linked finance and fiscal authority to service provision 2) the local government demonstrated their knowledge of costs of service provision; 3) the local governments collectively identifies their priorities; 4) the discussion was transparent and showed that transparency and accountability can also be woven into decentralization.
