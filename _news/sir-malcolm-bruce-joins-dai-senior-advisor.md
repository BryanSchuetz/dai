DAI is delighted to announce that Sir Malcolm Bruce has joined the firm in an advisory capacity, effective immediately. A distinguished public servant, Bruce brings to DAI more than 40 years of experience spanning government, private industry, and non-profit roles. As the M.P. for the Scottish constituency of Gordon, he served in the British House of Commons for 32 years, chairing the International Development Committee from 2005 to 2015.

"Having monitored international development as Chair of the IDC for the past 10 years, I am delighted to continue my association with this sector," said Bruce (pictured at left). "Having seen some of the work DAI has carried out for the U.K. Department for International Development, I have been impressed and am looking forward to gaining more understanding of DAI and its people."

"Effective development can be transformational and I passionately believe we should strain every sinew to end absolute poverty over the next few years," he added. "Organisations like DAI are central to this effort."

In his role as senior advisor, Bruce will visit field sites, attend learning events, represent the firm in high-level delegations, and counsel senior management on strategic and operational issues. [Christopher Lockett][2], DAI Senior Vice President, welcomed Bruce to the team:

"As development professionals, we must stay attuned to the strategic challenges facing our clients and our industry," said Lockett (pictured at right). "Malcolm's far-sightedness and breadth of experience, his knowledge of domestic and international governments, and his grasp of the issues shaping the development landscape will strengthen DAI as we seek to navigate that terrain."

A former deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Bruce was first elected in 1983, winning his seat in seven consecutive general elections. He was named a Privy Councillor in 2006, knighted in the Queen's Jubilee Birthday Honours of 2012, and appointed to the House of Lords in this year's Dissolution Honours. He is a long-time advocate for the hearing impaired, and a former president of GLOBE International, an organisation of parliamentarians from more than 80 countries committed to implementing laws in pursuit of sustainable development.
