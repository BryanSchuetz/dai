During the luncheon, Boomgard spoke with the Prime Minister about DAI's experience in Libya working with the Private Investment Board and the Ministry of Local Government as well as other ways DAI can help Libya to diversify its economy.

In prepared remarks, Prime Minister Zeidan and Foreign Minister Abdel Aziz described private sector engagement as essential for accomplishing the core goals of the Libyan revolution, namely integrating former fighters back into the national workforce.

Both leaders pledged to remove impediments to foreign investment. In addition to meeting with business leaders, the Prime Minister also met with President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Members of Congress.
