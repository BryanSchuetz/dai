DAI is the top-ranked firm globally in social sector consulting, according to the inaugural issue of _WhoKnowsAbout_, a “global competence ranking” of management consulting companies.

Analyzing the skills and experience of more than 500,000 individual consultants, the new rankings assess nearly 1,200 consulting companies in 15 industry and 15 topic areas. DAI was ranked as the top firm in Social Sector & Nonprofit consulting.

“Until now, buyers of consulting services could only rely on the general reputation of consulting companies when sourcing a project team,” wrote _WhoKnowsAbout_ co-founder Christopher McEwan in an article [introducing the rankings](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whoknowsabout-global-competence-ranking-management-companies-mcewan/). “The _WhoKnowsAbout_ rankings allow buyers to identify the firms and individual consultants that have the specific expertise required, offering a much more reliable track to securing value through consulting projects.”

The rankings do not represent ongoing performance evaluation, McEwan told DAI in a follow-up interview, but there is the potential to incorporate client feedback as the product evolves. “Right now, we think of it as the basis for shortlisting,” he said. “Our fundamental intent was to create an information base through which clients can match consultants to their needs.”
