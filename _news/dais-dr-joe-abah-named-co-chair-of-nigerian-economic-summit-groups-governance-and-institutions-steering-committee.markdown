DAI’s Joe Abah was recently named as Co-Chair of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group and will serve on its Steering Committee on Governance and Institutions. 

The [Nigerian Economic Summit Group](https://nesgroup.org/) is a private sector-led organization promoting free market principles, ethical business practices, and good governance. The group supports the formulation and implementation of social and economic reform programmes for the transformation of the Nigerian economy and leads research, drives advocacy, implements programmes, and hosts policy discourse events. 

Each year the group hosts the Nigerian Economic Summit, a platform for public-private dialogue on the future of the Nigerian Economy—the 25th Nigerian Economic Summit takes place this October.
