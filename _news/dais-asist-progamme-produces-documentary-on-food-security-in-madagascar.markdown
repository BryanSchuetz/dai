The [Advisory Service Social Transfers (ASiST III) Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-and-advisory-services-social-transfers-asist), funded by the European Commission, recently premiered a documentary video it produced to highlight the work done by Europe Union projects in Madagascar to assist smallholder farmers in adopting best food and agricultural practices.

The 26-minute video highlights some of the impact of the techniques taught to farmers—all in an effort to move communities from crisis to resilience. Some of those techniques included advanced pisciculture, or the controlled breeding and rearing of fish, training young rural people how to produce nutrient-rich crops, and facilitating the formation of smallholder associations.

The work was performed from 2012 to 2017 over seven regions of Madagascar through the [Food Security Thematic Programme (FSTP)](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sectors/food-and-agriculture/food-and-nutrition-security/food-security-thematic-programme-fstp_en). ASiST, as part of its mandate to share knowledge, produced the video and presented the results this week at an Infopoint conference in Brussels. 

“The projects funded by FSTP,” said Caroline Broudic, ASiST consultant, “introduced innovation at the local level. The main challenge of an innovation is often its sustainability. Proper decision-making and knowledge transmission are then as important as the innovations themselves.”
