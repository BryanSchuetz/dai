DAI President and CEO [Dr. James Boomgard][1], currently in Libya, today issued the following statement from Tripoli:

> "Libyans have made enormous progress over the past months as they have begun the long, hard process of building a new country. The [violence in Benghazi][2] that took the life of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and other Consulate staff is the work of a tiny minority of Libyans intent on derailing the country's commitment to positive change. We cannot allow last night's event to diminish support for constructive progress in Libya."
