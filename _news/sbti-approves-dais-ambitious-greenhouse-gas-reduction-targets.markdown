Specifically, DAI has [signed up](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-race-to-zero-campaign-accelerating-companys-trajectory-to-net-zero) to the [Business Ambition for 1.5°C](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/business-ambition-for-1-5c/) campaign, which commits signatories to a net-zero target of emissions cuts that align with global efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. DAI has committed to reducing absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 from a 2019 base year.

The SBTi has established a set of criteria that all targets must meet in order to be validated as science-based. “The SBTi commends your ambitious 1.5°C-aligned target, currently the most ambitious designation available through the SBTi process,” the organization wrote in its approval communication.

“It just so happens that we received our approval on Earth Day, which made for a lovely bit of symbolism for our Net Zero Task Force,” said [Donald Lunan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/donald-lunan), DAI’s Global Director, Climate. “Now it’s up to the Task Force and all of us here at DAI to implement the framework, meet these targets, and ensure DAI is doing its part to advance meaningful climate action.”
