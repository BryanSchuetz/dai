Two innovations supported by the DAI-led, U.S. Agency for International Development-funded [Jalin](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-jalin) project recently received Indonesia Healthcare Innovation Awards in the categories of "Healthcare Movement for Healthy Women Workers" and "Information and Communication Technology in the Health Sector."  

The awards, organized annually by the Indonesia Healthcare Forum (IndoHCF) recognize agencies, individuals, groups, academics, and other parties that have successfully developed and implemented innovations to support national health programs and improve health services in Indonesia. A total of 138 innovators across the country were considered for the awards and shortlisted to include 10 nominees for five categories. 
    

USAID Jalin has collaborated with the Semarang City Health Office, the Central Java Provincial Health Office, and partner garment factories to improve access to quality maternal and newborn health (MNH) services for female factory workers through its MNH in the Workplace initiative. The Gepuk Pepes program aims to strengthen the services and facilities of the existing factory clinics, improve health promotion and prevention programs, and improve company management policies to support maternal and child health. The workplace-based initiative represents an innovative approach to improving the health and wellbeing of female factory workers while also benefitting employers. In response to the award announcement, Endah, Head of Public Health Division in Semarang City Health Office emphasized that the success of Gepuk Pepes can be attributed to multi-stakeholder efforts, including USAID Jalin’s key role in facilitating this collaboration. “It has become an effective solution for female workers to access quality maternal and neonatal health care in the workplace,” she noted.

At the national level, USAID Jalin, the Ministry of Health, and Perkumpulan Obstetri dan Ginekologi Indonesia (Indonesian Association for Obstetrics and Gynecology – POGI) have collaborated since 2019 to develop the MPDN tool and socialize its use to all health facilities in Indonesia. MPDN is a digital reporting application that updates Indonesia's manual death reporting system and will help to ensure real time, and accurate reporting of maternal and perinatal deaths across the country. Dr. Danu, one of the ObGyns who initiated MPDN, acknowledged feeling proud and honored when the award was announced. He said, “I felt very proud. MPDN is a fruit of my passion that is aligned with my specialty. It is a masterpiece [that was realized] with the help of [USAID] Jalin.” Dr. Danu also stressed that the recognition he and his team received is a stepping stone to reducing the Neonatal Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Ratio nationally.

The award winners will receive financial and in-kind equipment support as incentives to continue and scale-up their innovations. The judging panel represented 18 different institutions, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health, Ministry of Research and Technology, and Indonesian Institute of Sciences. The Indonesian Minister of Health, Terawan Agus Putranto, shared his aspiration during his speech at the event, “Hopefully, the awards can strengthen our determination to innovate towards self-reliance as a nation full of innovation.”
