A 2019 recipient of DAI's community service award is helping marginalized people in the Philippines become more self-sufficient. Last year, two DAI employees [received](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-intrahealth-employees-recognized-for-their-community-service) the company’s David H. Gunning Award for Community Service. Each awardee received $5,000 for donation to a social service organization of their choice. 

One recipient, Najalynn Caraway, has worked with [Project Teresa](https://www.facebook.com/projectteresainc/) since its founding in 2017, planning and organizing projects and coordinating with relevant agencies to deliver supplies to marginalized people in the Philippines. Project Teresa provides Filipino families with basic necessities, education, and resources. Najalynn’s donation funded multiple programs in 2020.

Project Teresa’s team were able to use the award to deliver assistance to residents affected by Typhoon Ursula in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro. They distributed school supplies, food, children’s vitamins, personal hygiene items, and mosquito nets to students and families of Labangan Elementary School. They also distributed school supplies and relief goods, cans of onion seeds to replenish lost crops, and solar powered flashlights in Barangay La Curva and San Isidro. The donation served 450 students, 100 families, and 20 farmers. 

Additionally, funds from the Gunning Award are being used to repair a school roof damaged by Typhoon Tisoy in another area of the Philippines.
