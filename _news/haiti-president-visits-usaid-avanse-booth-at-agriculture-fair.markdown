In honor of Agriculture and Labor Day, the President of the Republic of Haiti, Jovenel Moïse, visited the [Appui a la Valorisation du potentiel Agricole du Nord, pour la Securite Economique et Environnementale (AVANSE)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-appui-la-valorisation-du-potentiel-agricole-du-nord-la-securite-economique) exhibition at the Agricultural Fair held in northeast Haiti. He was accompanied by First Lady Martine Moïse, the President of the Superior Council of the Judiciary, Jules Cantave, the Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development, Joubert C. Angrand, and other government officials. 

Moïse visited the AVANSE infrastructure, natural resource management, plantain, commercialization, rice, and cocoa stalls where he chatted with technical leads and technicians. At the natural resource management stall, he asked to visit conservation blocks where the DAI-led project implements soil conservation activities.

At the cocoa exhibit, Moïse spoke with agronomist-engineer Raoul Jean Dominique about cocoa varieties, the grafting process, and received copies of AVANSE technical booklets related to cocoa grafting, pruning, and establishing nursery and cocoa orchards.

While at the infrastructure stand, President Moise took a copy of the topographic studies of rivers of the Nord and Nord East departments. These studies were commissioned by AVANSE and focus on interventions rivers in Trou du Nord, Haut du Cap, Grande Rivière du Nord, Jassa, Marion.

President Moïse visited the Fair after officially launching the commencement of works at the hydroelectric dam on the Marion River, Terrier Rouge in the North East.

The May 1st Fair was held under the theme "Manage our waters to increase national production," brought together various projects and partner institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture, including the United Nations Food Organization and Agriculture (FAO) and the Strengthening Public Agricultural Services Project (RESEPAG).
