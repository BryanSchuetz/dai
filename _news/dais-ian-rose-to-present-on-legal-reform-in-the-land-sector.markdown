[Ian Rose](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/ian-rose), DAI’s Senior Principal Global Practice Specialist for Land Tenure and Property Rights, will present at the upcoming [CASP](https://www.cta.org.mz/index.php/novidades/cta/716-xv-casp) conference in Mozambique. The annual conference, to be held November 29-30 in Maputo, highlights the country’s investment environment and is hosted by the [CTA](https://www.cta.org.mz/) (Confederação das Associações Económicas de Moçambique), the leading association of the private sector in Mozambique.

Conference organizers are expecting 700 people to attend.

One of this year’s themes is how to improve secure access to land for commercial development projects. Rose will present on potential market-oriented legal reforms in the land sector, highlighting proposals to streamline and facilitate transfer of land rights in rural areas.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded [Supporting the Policy Environment for Economic Development (SPEED\+)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-support-program-economic-and-enterprise-development-speed) project is supporting the conference. One of the project’s main goals is to support legal reforms in the land sector. Over the course of the first SPEED program, which DAI also led, SPEED [successfully](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/reforming-business-policy-mozambique/) expanded policy reforms, resulting in increased trade and investment, a stronger competitive position for Mozambican firms, and more local job opportunities. SPEED\+ works to further develop a favorable business environment to attract investment, expand markets, and reduce costs, thus contributing to broad-based and inclusive economic growth and conservation of natural resources.

DAI’s Land Tenure and Property Rights practice works across [all types of tenure](http://dai-global-developments.com/developing-alternatives/land-rights/) systems—customary, private, and public—to strengthen the security and rights of land users by focusing on the reforms and capacity building that are appropriate in each context.
