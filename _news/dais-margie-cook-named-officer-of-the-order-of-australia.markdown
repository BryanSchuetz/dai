Cook previously led the [Drivers of Accountability Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-drivers-accountability-programme-dap) for DAI, where her team worked with Kenyan government and non-government parties to reduce impunity, deliver legislative reforms, increase accountability, and increase citizen participation. Margie managed electoral programs for the UN from 2001 to 2010 and since 1987 has consulted for Australia’s National Nine Television Network in its national and state election coverage and data program.
