DAI's [Land Tenure and Property Rights team][1] presented four papers at the Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty 2016, on March 14–18, in Washington, D.C.

The event, attended by hundreds of key stakeholders from governments, civil society, academia, the development community, and the private sector, is in its 17th year. The theme of this year's conference was "Scaling up Responsible Land Governance." Conference participants discussed what can be done to "guarantee inclusiveness, sustainability, and reliability, build capacity, and ensure that better land information and more tenure security contribute to wider societal objectives and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals."

DAI's papers covered topics including ensuring [women are not overlooked][3] in land titling systems; setting up [sustainable systems][4] once donor funding ends; the importance of [monitoring land][5] programs; and lastly, an update on the issuing of [second-level land certificates][5] in Ethiopia.

"The DAI Lands team was delighted to showcase our current ongoing major land work in [Ethiopia][6], [Tanzania][7], and [Cape Verde][8] and to interact with our partners and donors on these large and important programmes," said [James Green][9], Director, DAI.

Our land work includes securing property rights, supporting policy and legal reforms and regularization, cadaster development, land record rehabilitation and management, land information systems, institution building and information dissemination, participatory land use and resource planning, dispute resolution and mitigation, training, research and communications, and grants management. DAI currently works on the land issues for the U.K. Department for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the European Union, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, for which it holds an indefinite quantity contract, [Strengthening Tenure and Resource Rights (STARR)][10].
