DAI is pleased to be hosting two labs at the annual European Development Days event in Brussels on June 3–4.

This year is the European Year for Development ([#EYD2015][1]) and Development Days (EDD15) will be its flagship event. The forum is an incubator of new ideas to inform our shared aim of a poverty-free, sustainable, and fair world where everyone has a chance at a decent life.

The EDD15 programme features more than 130 sessions—high-level discussions, lab debates, brainstorming sessions, and press conferences with breaking news. Global leaders, visionaries, and experts on development cooperation will network with professionals from around the world. The Project Village will showcase innovative projects and reports that are solving the world's most pressing challenges in new ways.

DAI's First Lab, "ACP/EU Microfinance Programme: Poverty alleviation through economic growth," explores pro-poor access to finance, consumer empowerment, capacity building, and support of equitable and efficient local markets. We will present the groundbreaking work of DAI's EU-funded [African, Caribbean, and Pacific–European Union Microfinance Programme][3], the main objectives of which mirrored the #EYD2015 June theme: Sustainable Green Growth, Decent Jobs and Businesses. The programme developed inclusive financial systems, adapted to the needs of the poor in African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries. Three of our grantees will present how access to finance and private sector development can benefit the poorest and lead to sustainable growth. The lab takes place June 4.

Our Second Lab, "Land Tenure in Africa: Lessons learned and the road ahead," also June 4, focuses on what development partners should be doing to improve land rights and create sustainable solutions. Drawing on [DAI's experience][4] in Africa, our expert panel will present on issues such as improving land tenure, supporting women's rights, and how to ensure large-scale investments contribute to local livelihoods. Our session will encourage discussion on how to find innovative approaches to land tenure challenges.
