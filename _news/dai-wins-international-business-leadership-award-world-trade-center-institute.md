![][1]DAI has been named a winner in the World Trade Center Institute's 16th Annual Maryland International Business Leadership Award program. Represented by CEO [Jim Boomgard][2], DAI was one of seven winners chosen from a pool of 80 independently nominated companies from the state. Winning companies were selected based on their success in international business, growth in revenue and employment, and community involvement.

Bethesda-based DAI—with global offices in London, Ramallah, Amman, Mexico City, Johannesburg, and Islamabad—was also recently [named][3] a Devex Top 40 Development Innovator, one of only 10 consulting firms so honored globally.

DAI works in more than 60 countries delivering solutions ranging from reforming the Government of Jordan's fiscal systems to promoting household nutrition gardens that provide food and income for HIV/AIDS-affected people in Ethiopia and incentivizing water service providers in rural Cambodia to pipe clean water to more customers.

"As a global development company, we live and breathe the challenges of international business and seek to leverage business principles in our mission of shaping a more livable world," said Boomgard. "On behalf of our employee owners in Maryland and all over the world, I'd like to thank the World Trade Center Institute for this tremendous honor."

All 2012 International Business Leadership Award winners will be honored March 7 at the Jim Rouse Visionary Center in Baltimore at a ceremony featuring Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels, Gov. Martin O'Malley, and nearly 400 top business leaders.
