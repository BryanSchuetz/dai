DAI today announced that it is joining forces with [Local Content Solutions Ltd](http://www.localcontentsolutions.com/). (LCS). Led by Dr. Michael Warner, the U.K.-based LCS is a global leader in providing consulting and software solutions to governments developing and overseeing local content regimes, and companies seeking to optimize their local workforce and local supply chains.

“We are delighted to welcome Michael and his company to the DAI team,” said [Zachary Kaplan](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/zachary-kaplan), Director of DAI’s [Energy & Resources Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/corporate-sustainability). “Michael is recognized as the pre-eminent thought and practice leader in the space of local content and local supply chain development. He will enrich our thinking in this area, and in turn DAI will afford him a more powerful global platform to amplify the impact of his work.”

The Energy & Resources Group works at the intersection of development and business. In the oil, gas, mining, and infrastructure sectors, the Group delivers services in corporate social investment, government and community engagement, and local content and related supply chain management.

Local content is fast becoming a legal compliance requirement affecting major investments and project authorization, requiring investors, operators, and major contractors to meet regulatory requirements for use of local workers and suppliers while at the same time meeting the cost, schedule, and quality objectives of the business.

As such, optimizing local content is now an investment-critical activity, and the DAI/LCS combination provides a formidable array of experienced personnel and proven tools to help governments and companies achieve their objectives in this area.

In combination, DAI and LCS draw on a wide range of experience working with commercial clients including Anadarko Corporation, BG Group, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Kosmos Energy, Maersk Group, Newmont Mining Corporation, Schlumberger, Shell, and Statoil—as well as numerous public sector authorities and organizations.

> “I am joining DAI because it shares my commitment to a disciplined, quantitative, data-driven approach to optimizing local content,” said Michael Warner. “The transition to DAI will be seamless for my current clients but ultimately transformative in terms of delivering efficient regulation, meeting business objectives, and realizing social benefits.”

“Importantly, DAI also shares LCS’s client-driven approach to relationship management,” added Warner. “Together, we will ensure that we continue to deliver the highest level of technical excellence and value to each client, individually.”

Building on Dr. Warner’s 25 years of expertise and experience in the oil, gas, and mining space, LCS has developed proprietary performance management tools and software that will serve as the capstone to the Energy & Resources Group’s already powerful Local Content Suite of Services. The Local Content Suite provides clients with a complete line of local content solutions, from forecasting and diagnostics of local industrial capabilities to local supplier vendor management systems and registration portals. LCS’s software and tools complement these capabilities by assisting clients to prepare local content plans, integrate local content in contract tendering, and report on local content activities against host country regulations and requirements using a customizable online platform. 

LCS is also an established training provider, fully accredited by the British Accreditation Council as a provider of short courses. Its Local Content MasterClass is the industry standard for local content training globally. 
A full-time member of the DAI team, Michael Warner will continue to be based in the United Kingdom
