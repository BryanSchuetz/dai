The Compact is, in its own words, a “voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles,” with a mission to “mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want.”

Member companies are required to align their strategies and operations with 10 principles covering human rights and labor rights, environmental sustainability, and ethical business practices; and to advance social progress as articulated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DAI joined the Compact in 2018.

> “As we look forward to 2019 and to our 50th year of operations in 2020, we are challenging ourselves to deliver greater and greater value to our partners around the world, and we find ourselves working in exciting new ways,” wrote DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard in his introduction. “In all of these endeavors, we remain committed to shaping a more livable world in the spirit of the UN Global Compact and its underlying principles.”

DAI looks forward to advancing the SDGs through more than 100 projects over the next 12 months and to reporting our progress in due course.
