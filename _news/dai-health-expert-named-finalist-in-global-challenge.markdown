The Challenge “seeks to connect women changemakers who are collaborating with unlikely partners—across businesses, governments, and many other sectors—while supporting their organizations’ efforts to promote gender equality and economic empowerment.

Adamu, a sociologist by training, has expertise in gender, poverty, and equity issues in northern Nigeria. She currently works on the Women for Health (W4H) programme, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development.

She was one of 12 finalists—chosen from more than 150 entries—named by Ashoka. She will attend a Finalists Exchange event June 20 to 22 in Johannesburg, South Africa, ahead of the Impact!Africa Summit, to prepare a session for the summit. The summit is a gathering of social entrepreneurs from across the continent. Attendees come from sectors such as policy, social investment, business and education.
