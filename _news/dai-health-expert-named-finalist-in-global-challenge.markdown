![Fatima Adamu dai site-4a4687.jpg](/uploads/Fatima%20Adamu%20dai%20site-4a4687.jpg){:.float-left} Our own [Dr. Fatima Adamu](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/fatima-adamu) has been named a finalist in the “Challenging Norms, Powering Economies” Challenge, an initiative of Ashoka, Open Society Foundation, and UN Women.

The [Challenge](https://womenschallenge.ashoka.org/) “seeks to connect women changemakers who are collaborating with unlikely partners—across businesses, governments, and many other sectors—while supporting their organizations’ efforts to promote gender equality and economic empowerment.

Adamu, a sociologist by training, has expertise in gender, poverty, and equity issues in northern Nigeria. She currently works on the [Women for Health (W4H)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-women-for-health-w4h) programme, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development.

She was one of 12 finalists—chosen from more than 150 entries—named by Ashoka. She will attend a Finalists Exchange event June 20 to 22 in Johannesburg, South Africa, ahead of the [Impact!Africa Summit](https://www.impact-africa.co.za/), to prepare a session for the summit. The summit is a gathering of social entrepreneurs from across the continent. Attendees come from sectors such as policy, social investment, business and education. At that event, the 12 finalists will participate in a “collaborative engagement to improve ideas to apply for prizes.”
