DAI is pleased to have been selected to host a lab and a stand at the annual European Development Days (EDD) event in Brussels on June 18–19.

EDD is Europe’s leading forum on development and international cooperation. Organised by the European Commission, the forum brings together the development community to share ideas and experience, inspiring new partnerships, and solutions to the world’s challenges. Each year the EDDs attracts more than 42,000 participants from more than 154 countries, representing 4,500 organisations from the development community. 

This year’s theme is “Addressing inequalities: building a world which leaves no one behind” to promote a safer, more inclusive, and open world for all. 

DAI’s stand features our work with Kosmos Energy in Ghana on supporting technology-driven entrepreneurship. KIC promotes innovation and youth employment by investing in and facilitating the development of Ghanaian entrepreneurs and businesses. DAI staff will be on hand at stand 70 to answer questions and we will share our lessons learned in the form of a research paper, providing valuable insights for implementers, funders and designers. 

Our report lab “Let’s Talk! Public-private dialogue: a booster for inclusive and sustainable growth” will take place on June 18 at 15:15, bringing together an EU policy officer, a Belgian entrepreneur, a Team Leader supervising an EU funded project in the Virunga National Park (DRC) a representative of the Moroccan Government, and an international expert in the rights of indigenous people. Guided by the TPSD Facility, the panel will go back to the rationale of private sector engagement and the need to join forces with businesses and the civil society to build more inclusive economies. It will explore different cases of public-private dialogue initiatives and use them to highlight the successes and challenges of the EU’s new approach to development cooperation.
