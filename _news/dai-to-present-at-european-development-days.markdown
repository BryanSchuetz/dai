DAI is pleased to have been selected to host a lab and a stand at the annual [European Development Days (EDD)](https://eudevdays.eu/) event in Brussels on June 18–19.

EDD is Europe’s leading forum on development and international cooperation. Organised by the European Commission, the forum brings together the development community to share ideas and experience. Each year EDD attracts more than 40,000 participants from more than 150 countries, representing 4,500 organisations from the development community.

This year’s theme is “Addressing inequalities: building a world which leaves no one behind.” 

DAI’s stand features [our work with Kosmos Energy](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-kosmos-innovation-center-kic) in Ghana on supporting technology-driven entrepreneurship. [KIC](https://www.kosmosinnovationcenter.com/) promotes innovation and youth employment by investing in and facilitating the development of Ghanaian entrepreneurs and businesses. DAI staff will be on hand at [stand 70](https://www.eudevdays.eu/community/sessions/2535/kosmos-innovation-centre-ghana-supporting-technology-driven-entrepreneurship) to answer questions and we will share our lessons learned in a research paper, providing insights for implementers, funders, and designers. 

Our [report lab](https://eudevdays.eu/community/sessions/2510/lets-talk-public-private-dialogue-a-booster-for-inclusive-and-sustainable-growth), “Let’s Talk! Public-private dialogue: a booster for inclusive and sustainable growth,” takes place on June 18 at 15:15. It brings together a European Union (EU) policy officer, a Belgian entrepreneur, a Team Leader supervising an EU-funded project in the Virunga National Park (Democratic Republic of Congo), a representative of the Moroccan Government, and an international expert in the rights of indigenous people. Hosted by the [Trade, Private Sector Development, and Engagement (TPSD/E)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-trade-private-sector-development-and-engagement-and-regional-integration-facility) facility, the panel will discuss the rationale of private sector engagement and the need engage with businesses and civil society in building more inclusive economies. Exploring various public-private dialogue initiatives, it will highlight the successes and challenges of the EU’s new approach to development cooperation. 

Also on June 18, from 16:30, DAI will host a “meet & greet” moment in Room L2 with current and potential partners, clients, experts, and other EDD participants interested in finding out more about our work.
