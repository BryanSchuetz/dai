In response to the news that Cuba's Supreme Court has upheld a 15-year prison sentence imposed on DAI subcontractor Alan Gross for committing "acts against the integrity and independence of the state," DAI President and Chief Executive Officer James Boomgard issued the following statement:

"Once again, we find ourselves bitterly disappointed in the verdict of the Cuban court. Alan Gross has done nothing more than help peaceful people gain access to the Internet, and for that he has already served more than a year and a half in prison. Despite today's ruling, we urge that the Cuban government take into account the medical situation confronting Alan and his family, and quickly allow him to come home."

Alan Gross was detained by Cuban authorities in December 2009. Gross' company, JBDC, was a small business subcontractor to DAI under its prime contract to implement the U.S. Agency for International Development's Cuba Democracy and Contingency Planning Program.
