DAI has been named a finalist in the 2012 Helios HR Apollo Awards, in the largest company category alongside Booz Allen Hamilton, Deltek, Ogilvy Washington, SRA International, Inc., and Washington Gas.

The awards go to companies that have "demonstrated a superior level of focus on employee development and engagement," according to the award's sponsor, Helios HR, a Washington, D.C.-based human resources management firm. "The finalists of Apollo represent how companies in the D.C. region invest tremendous energy into creating programs that value employees as a critical component to achieving their overall business goals."

"DAI is passionate about employee development and engagement and is proud of its 40-year track record as an employer of choice in the global development community," said Laura Viehmyer, the company's Vice President of Human Resources.

Employee-owned DAI was named a finalist on the basis of its professional development opportunities for all employees, its thorough on-boarding process to orient new employees, and its committee that focuses solely on identifying training needs and coordinating learning activities across the company, among other factors.

In 2010, DAI was [named][3] the most exceptional company in Maryland by _The Gazette of Politics and Business_, due in part to its innovative and participatory human resources approach.     

The finalists will be honored May 30 at an event—co-sponsored by Helios HR and Washington SmartCEO magazine—at the McLean Hilton.
