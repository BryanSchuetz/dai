DAI has launched [Unburdened](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-podcast), a podcast that gives DAI’s cut on global health issues that go beyond healthcare. 

[Kirsten Weeks](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kirsten-weeks), Vice President of Global Health at DAI, said, “So much of what we’ve experienced with COVID-19 is how global health affects our entire lives. This podcast is a way to explore how things such as equity, pollution, governance, and economics impact our wellbeing—and discover what we can do about it.” 

Unburdened’s first, five-episode series asks the question: "Can gender equality make us healthier?" It uses the United Nations’ gender inequality index to frame discussions.

The five episodes include: 

[Episode 1](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-1/): Can gender equality make us healthier? Most of us agree that equality is a good thing, but is there more than a moral argument for making our societies more equal?  

[Episode 2](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-2/): Why aren’t men and women equal? If there’s a gap between men and women, how do we know that empirically?  

[Episode 3](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-3/): Can female politicians make us healthier? Will more female politicians in positions of power make our societies healthier?   

[Episode 4](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-4/): Can better reproductive health make us more equal? How society treats a woman during pregnancy and childbirth is a signal of women’s status in society. Do we value maternal health as integral to the health of our communities?  

[Episode 5](https://dai-global-developments.com/unburdened-season-1/episode-5/): Where do we go from here? As development practitioners and public health professionals, how do we make our work more gender equal?   

Episodes follow a narrative storyline and feature DAI’s own experts as well as academics and experts from outside the company. The show is hosted by Megan Howe, a communications advisor and specialist in DAI’s [Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health) unit. Having worked in the humanitarian and development field for most of her career, Megan hopes the podcast will make discussions around global health accessible, jargon-free, and inspiring to health and non-health professionals alike.
