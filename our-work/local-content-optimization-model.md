## What is LCOM?

Our Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM) is a custom tool that supports data-driven decision making around local content procurement strategy. Using LCOM, we analyze the supply and demand for local goods, services, and labor and build strategies to tap into them. LCOM seamlessly integrates with our suite of services to provide comprehensive and fully functional solutions for our clients in the countries where they work.

## Local Content Forecasting

The forecasting of local content is performed using DAI's LCOM software. LCOM simulates the procurements that typically occur over the life of a specific capital project based on inputs on spend and local capacity to provide a range of likely local content forecasts.

## Supplier Readiness Determination

Key to LCOM's forecasts are data on each local supply chain's ability to compete for and participate in work from our client's investments. This data is rigorously gathered by SBG specialists through firm-level and expert interviews, as well as extensive desk research.

## How Does LCOM Fit Within the SBG Suite of Services?

LCOM's forecasts sync directly to SBG's Supplier Registration and Pre-Qualification Portal (SRQP) and [ Local Content Plan and Reporting Platform (LCPR)](/our-work/solutions/corporate/local-content-and-supply-chain-management). LCOM's data assessing local supplier readiness populates the SRQP.
