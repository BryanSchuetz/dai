> “Certainly the prime Local Content course in
> the market. Highly recommended.” — *International oil field services Local Content Manager*

Since mid-2015, the topic of Local Content has taken center stage across the globe, and with it the need for a new profession to implement fast-developing local content compliance regimes and deliver tangible local benefits as a balance to unrestrained globalization.

## Why Does Local Content Matter?

Local Content has the potential to provide a significant political and monetary contribution to the host economy from major inward investments.

DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) tackles the growing challenges facing private sector companies (investor, operators, contractors) and public authorities in meeting Local Content regulations and supporting sustainable industrial development of host economies through capital investments.

The challenges include:

* Since 2015, **dramatic falls** in commodity oil and gas prices and challenging metal and mineral prices

* Uncertain **global demand** for oil and gas and mining products

* Uneven **global recovery** after the 2008 shock, which has driven many governments to seek to privatize public infrastructure operations and investments to reduce government expenditure budgets

* Limited government and **regulatory capacity**

* Growing trend for governments to pass and/or strengthen **Local Content legislation**, regulations, and policy due to realization that globalization does not always demonstrably benefit local populations

* Balancing the **unintended consequences of globalization** with the **risks of protectionism** for inflation, disinvestment, unemployment, and recession

## What is the Master Class?

* Offered as a **four-day** or **three day** training program convering the full landscape of Local Content.

* Framed by the **regional context** of Local Content regulation and sector development.

* Compriosed of **lectures**, hands-on **group exercises**, **computer modelling**, and video **case studies**.

* Examines **strategic alignment** of refulations, industrial policy, and commercial interests, **smart procurement** to manage Local Content, and the mechanics/metrics of Local Content.
