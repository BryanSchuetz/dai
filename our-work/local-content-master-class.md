Since 2015, the topic of local content has taken center stage, and with it the need for a new profession to implement fast-developing local content compliance regimes and deliver tangible local benefits as a balance to unrestrained globalization.

## Why Does Local Content Matter?

Local content has the potential to provide significant contributions to the host economy from major inward investments.

DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) tackles the growing challenges facing private sector companies (investors, operators, contractors) and public authorities in meeting local content regulations and supporting the sustainable industrial development of host economies through capital investments.

> "The course has given me great insight... and covered all the important areas of local content: policy, procurement and metrics."—*Project Co-ordinator for Local Content, Ministry of Energy, Ghana*

These challenges include:

* Since 2015, **dramatic falls** in commodity oil, gas prices and challenging metal and mineral price
* Uncertain **global demand** for oil, gas, and mining products
* Uneven **global recovery** after the 2008 shock, which has driven many governments to seek to privatize public infrastructure operations and investments to reduce government expenditures
* Limited government and **regulatory capacity**
* Growing trend for governments to pass and/or strengthen **local content legislation**, regulations, and policy due to realization that globalization does not always demonstrably benefit local populations
* Balancing the **unintended consequences of globalization** with the **risks of protectionism** in terms of inflation, disinvestment, unemployment, and recession

<hr>

## What is the Master Class?

* A **three-day** training covering the full landscape of local content.
* Framed by the **regional context** of local content regulation and sector development.
* Consists of **lectures**, hands-on **group exercises**, **computer modeling**, and **video case studies**.
* Examines **strategic alignment** of regulations, industrial policy, and commercial interests; **smart procurement** to manage local content; and the **mechanics** of local content.

<hr>

## Who Can Participate?

To stimulate engagement and cross-learning between participants, we make every effort to invite individuals from a range of organizations involved in local content management. Typical participants include:

* **National and international oil, gas, and mining companies**: This category could include individuals from commercial departments, contracting and procurement, external and government affairs, human resources, social performance, and those in sustainable development roles.
* **National and international companies involved in other capital intensive sectors such as infrastructure, transportation, renewable energy, utilities, and water management**: Individuals from commercial departments, contracting and procurement, external and government affairs, human resources, social performance and sustainable development.
* **Government policy-making authorities**: Staff working at the national or provincial level engaged in industrial policy, private sector development, supply chain linkage programs, and the promotion of inward investment and exports.
* **Host-country regulatory agencies**: Officials responsible for setting local content targets, compiling aggregate demand, assessing local market capability, managing registers of domestic suppliers, and engaging in tendering processes.
* **International and larger-scale domestic contractor suppliers**: Those who manage local supply chains, source globally, and/or have business development interests in emerging economies. Relevant departments include business development, account management, marketing, service delivery, production, human resources, social performance, and sustainable development.
* **Local supplier business and trade associations**
* **Official development agencies and development finance institutions**: Personnel who work in procurement departments, oil, gas, mining, and infrastructure departments, and business linkage advisory services.

> "The course was beyond my expectations. I thought I was coming for validation, but actually learnt many new insights"—*Head of Strategy and Policy Development, Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board*
>
> “Certainly the prime local content course in the market. Highly recommended.”—*Local Content Manager, International oil field services company*
