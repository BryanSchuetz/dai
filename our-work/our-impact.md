We envision a world in which communities and societies become more prosperous, fairer and better governed, safer, healthier, and environmentally more sustainable. Integral to that mission is a commitment to uphold human rights and labor standards, promote environmental responsibility, and combat corruption in all its forms.

             <p>“The livable world at the heart of DAI’s mission is, inconceivable in the absence of a habitable planet,” writes DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard in his introduction. “Even as we fight the most lethal pandemic in a century, responsible companies must increasingly turn their attention to a pervasive threat that will remain the world’s biggest challenge long after COVID-19 has become a manageable disease: that threat is climate change.”</p>
