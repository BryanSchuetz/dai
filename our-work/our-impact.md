We envision a world in which communities and societies become more prosperous, fairer and better governed, safer, healthier, and environmentally more sustainable. Integral to that mission is a commitment to uphold human rights and labor standards, promote environmental responsibility, and combat corruption in all its forms.
 
 **You can learn more about our commitment to Shape a More Livable World** by reviewing our [UNGC Communication on Progress](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-submits-its-2020-communication-on-progress-to-the-un-global-compact) for the current and previous years below.

             <p>“The livable world at the heart of DAI’s mission is, inconceivable in the absence of a habitable planet,” Boomgard continues. “Even as we come together to fight the most lethal pandemic in a century, responsible companies must increasingly turn their attention to a pervasive threat that will remain the world’s biggest challenge long after COVID-19 has become a manageable disease: that threat is climate change.”</p>

             <p>“We have positioned DAI to provide development services at the confluence of three great resource streams: donor-funded development assistance; direct investments by private enterprises seeking to operate in developing countries; and development finance,” writes DAI President and CEO Jim Boomgard in his introduction. “These resource flows have the potential to lift billions of people out of poverty.”</p>

 With regard to COVID-19, our first priority was ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting public health measures. Like many organizations, we curtailed travel and in-person interaction, enhanced our digital capabilities, and found creative ways to work remotely-even on projects in the field. 
 
 This year—DAI’s 50th anniversary—turned out to be perhaps the most extraordinary year in our half century of operation, thanks largely to the COVID-19 pandemic but also to an energized movement for racial and social justice that has particular salience for any organization committed to human welfare and global citizenship. In the wake of the George Floyd killing, we announced a companywide commitment to weave anti-racism into the fabric of our corporate culture, and pledged to devote at least $1 million to this effort.
