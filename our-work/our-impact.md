We envision a world in which communities and societies become more prosperous, fairer and better governed, safer, healthier, and environmentally more sustainable. Integral to that mission is a commitment to uphold human rights and labor standards, promote environmental responsibility, and combat corruption in all its forms.

 This year—DAI’s 50th anniversary—turned out to be perhaps the most extraordinary year in our half century of operation, thanks largely to the COVID-19 pandemic but also to an energized movement for racial and social justice that has particular salience for any organization committed to human welfare and global citizenship. In the wake of the George Floyd killing, we announced a companywide commitment to weave anti-racism into the fabric of our corporate culture, and pledged to devote at least $1 million to this effort.

 With regard to COVID-19, our first priority was ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting public health measures. Like many organizations, we curtailed travel and in-person interaction, enhanced our digital capabilities, and found creative ways to work remotely-even on projects in the field.
