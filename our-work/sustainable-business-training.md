## Energy 101 Training

DAI has been a capacity-building and stakeholder engagement partner for international energy companies around the world for the last half-decade. During this period DAI has conducted dozens of Energy workshops around the world, including in Senegal, Mauritania, Sao Tome, Mozambique, Guyana, and Suriname. The objective of the sessions is to build awareness of the Energy industry and develop the industry knowledge of various stakeholders.

### Who Can Participate?

So far, we have trained more than 400 individuals from the media, government, blogger activists, civil society, non-governmental organizations, environmental specialists, community leaders, mayor’s offices, governor’s offices, religious leaders, security forces, businesses, business associations, and several other stakeholder groups.

The sessions cover a range of topics including:

* Oil and gas fundamentals (industry characteristics, structure, players, value chain)

* Oil and gas project lifecycle

* Political economy dynamics in oil and gas

* Development opportunities and challenges

* Local content

* Introduction to fiscals for oil and gas

* Introduction to gas and LNG

In addition to general capacity-building and awareness programs, DAI also delivers training focused on specific project phases or events. An example is the training workshop on the fundamentals of the oil & gas industry delivered to Senegal’s ESIA Technical Committee in July 2018. The workshop, held in Dakar, was organized by the Directorate of the Environment under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in coordination with the operator BP. The objective of the workshop was to give participants a deeper technical understanding of the oil and gas industry to enhance their ability to assess the Tortue-1 ESIA document. The sessions covered the industry value chain; the process by which hydrocarbons are formed; technical aspects of the upstream segment, technologies used at different phases; gas composition, process processing and the LNG market; detailed breakdowns of different production facilities; and operational aspects of oil spill response.

## Small Business Recovery and Resilience Training

Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) comprise up to 95 percent of the world’s businesses and employ up to 60 percent of the workforce. However, MSMEs are more vulnerable to shocks than their larger counterparts, whether those shocks are economic, health-related, climatic, political, or otherwise. DAI’s small business recovery and resilience training takes businesses and startups through critical business tools and techniques to help stabilize, strengthen, and pivot their companies.

The modules are designed to:

* Develop stabilization plans for business continuity related to operations and workforce

* Manage cash flow, calculate runway, and develop a short-term financial strategy

* Analyze customer demand and pivot business model to seize current opportunities

* Adjust sales approach to current environment (such as leveraging e-commerce)

* Shore up supply chain to mitigate further risk

DAI’s small business recovery and resilience training can be delivered either as individual, targeted modules or as the holistic two-day MSME Resilience System.

### Who Can Participate?

* **Companies**: Support local suppliers, redirect corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to effective training for sustainable growth

* **Governments**: Accelerate MSME sector resilience as part of larger economic recovery efforts

* **Donors**: Adapt economic growth projects to current needs and realities

* **Financial institutions**: Reduce MSME portfolio risk and nonperforming loans

* **Industry associations**: Develop the resilience of member companies and support them as they adjust to a COVID-19 environment
