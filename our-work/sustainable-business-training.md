Since 2015, the topic of local content has taken center stage, and with it the need for a new profession to implement fast-developing local content compliance regimes and deliver tangible local benefits as a balance to unrestrained globalization.

<hr>

## Why Does Local Content Matter?

Local content has the potential to provide significant contributions to the host economy from major inward investments.

DAI’s [Sustainable Business Group](/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) tackles the growing challenges facing private sector companies (investors, operators, contractors) and public authorities in meeting local content regulations and supporting the sustainable industrial development of host economies through capital investments.

> "The course has given me great insight... and covered all the important areas of local content: policy, procurement and metrics."—*Project Co-ordinator for Local Content, Ministry of Energy, Ghana*

These challenges include:

* Since 2015, **dramatic falls** in commodity oil, gas prices and challenging metal and mineral price

* Uncertain **global demand** for oil, gas, and mining products

* Uneven **global recovery** after the 2008 shock, which has driven many governments to seek to privatize public infrastructure operations and investments to reduce government expenditures

* Limited government and **regulatory capacity**

* Growing trend for governments to pass and/or strengthen **local content legislation**, regulations, and policy due to realization that globalization does not always demonstrably benefit local populations

* Balancing the **unintended consequences of globalization** with the **risks of protectionism** in terms of inflation, disinvestment, unemployment, and recession

<hr>

## What is the Masterclass?

* A **three-day** training covering the full landscape of local content.

* Framed by the **regional context** of local content regulation and sector development.

* Consists of **lectures**, hands-on **group exercises**, **computer modeling**, and **video case studies**.

* Examines **strategic alignment** of regulations, industrial policy, and commercial interests; **smart procurement** to manage local content; and the **mechanics** of local content.

<hr>

## Who Can Participate?

To stimulate engagement and cross-learning between participants, we make every effort to invite individuals from a range of organizations involved in local content management. Typical participants include:

* **National and international oil, gas, and mining companies**: This category could include individuals from commercial departments, contracting and procurement, external and government affairs, human resources, social performance, and those in sustainable development roles.

* **National and international companies involved in other capital intensive sectors such as infrastructure, transportation, renewable energy, utilities, and water management**: Individuals from commercial departments, contracting and procurement, external and government affairs, human resources, social performance and sustainable development.

* **Government policy-making authorities**: Staff working at the national or provincial level engaged in industrial policy, private sector development, supply chain linkage programs, and the promotion of inward investment and exports.

* **Host-country regulatory agencies**: Officials responsible for setting local content targets, compiling aggregate demand, assessing local market capability, managing registers of domestic suppliers, and engaging in tendering processes.

* **International and larger-scale domestic contractor suppliers**: Those who manage local supply chains, source globally, and/or have business development interests in emerging economies. Relevant departments include business development, account management, marketing, service delivery, production, human resources, social performance, and sustainable development.

* **Local supplier business and trade associations**

* **Official development agencies and development finance institutions**: Personnel who work in procurement departments, oil, gas, mining, and infrastructure departments, and business linkage advisory services.

> "The course was beyond my expectations. I thought I was coming for validation, but actually learnt many new insights"—*Head of Strategy and Policy Development, Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board*
>
> “Certainly the prime local content course in the market. Highly recommended.”—*Local Content Manager, international oil field services company*

## Oil and Gas 101 Training

SBG has been a capacity-building and stakeholder engagement partner for international oil and gas companies around the world for the last half-decade. During this period SBG has conducted dozens of Oil and Gas 101 workshops in Senegal, Mauritania, Sao Tome, Mozambique, Guyana, and Suriname. The objective of the sessions is to build awareness around the oil and gas industry and develop the industry knowledge of various stakeholders.

## Who Can Participate?

So far, we have trained more than 400 individuals from the media, government, blogger activists, civil society, nongovernmental organizations, environmental specialists, community leaders, mayor’s offices, governor’s offices, religious leaders, security forces, businesses, business associations, and several other stakeholder groups.

The sessions cover a range of topics including:

* Oil and gas fundamentals (industry characteristics, structure, players, value chain)

* Oil and gas project lifecycle

* Political economy dynamics in oil and gas

* Development opportunities and challenges

* Local content

* Introduction to fiscals for oil and gas

* Introduction to gas and LNG

In addition to general capacity-building and awareness programs, SBG also delivers training focused on specific project phases or event. An example is the training workshop on the fundamentals of the oil & gas industry delivered to Senegal’s ESIA Technical Committee in July 2018. The workshop, held in Dakar, was organized by the Directorate of the Environment under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in coordination with the operator BP. The objective of the workshop was to give participants a deeper technical understanding of the oil and gas industry to enhance their ability to assess the Tortue-1 ESIA document. The sessions covered the industry value chain; the process by which hydrocarbons are formed; technical aspects of the upstream segment, technologies used at different phases; gas composition, process processing and the LNG market; detailed breakdowns of different production facilities; and operational aspects of oil spill response.

## Small Business Recovery and Resilience Training

Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) comprise up to 95 percent of the world’s businesses and employ up to 60 percent of the workforce. However, MSMEs are more vulnerable to shocks than their larger counterparts, whether those shocks are economic, health-related, climatic, political, or otherwise. DAI’s small business recovery and resilience training takes businesses and startups through critical business tools and techniques to help stabilize, strengthen, and pivot their companies.

The modules are designed to:

* Develop stabilization plans for business continuity related to operations and workforce

* Manage cash flow, calculate runway, and develop a short-term financial strategy

* Analyze customer demand and pivot business model to seize current opportunities

* Adjust sales approach to current environment (such as leveraging e-commerce)

* Shore up supply chain to mitigate further risk

DAI’s small business recovery and resilience training can be delivered either as individual, targeted modules or as the holistic two-day MSME Resilience System.

## Who Can Participate?

* **Companies**: Support local suppliers, redirect corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to effective training for sustainable growth

* **Governments**: Accelerate MSME sector resilience as part of larger economic recovery efforts

* **Donors**: Adapt economic growth projects to current needs and realities

* **Financial institutions**: Reduce MSME portfolio risk and nonperforming loans

* **Industry associations**: Develop the resilience of member companies and support them as they adjust to a COVID-19 environment

## Customized Courses

DAI leads customized courses upon request for private sector or government clients. Previous customized course locations include Canada, Ghana, Guyana, Oman, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania.
