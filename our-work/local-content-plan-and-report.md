## Fully configurable to different Local Content requirements, metrics, and key performance indicators

The uniquness of the platform is that it saves clients money and months of software programming, because the tool can be rapidly configured (ie zero additional software coding) to virtually any policy, law, regulation or corporate or country strategy on Local Content in a matter of just a few days.

The platform can be up and running ‘live‘ in a couple of weeks, including completion of on-line or workshop-based training of users (3 days trainnig to regulator/corporation level, 1 day trainng to company Procurement and HR managers).

## Fully flexible company structure and unlimited supply chain users

**Super User** roles can be set up at regulator or corporate level, and for each reporting company. Super Users create the company structure
and lower-tier users—allocating to each the ability to add, view or edit data. Other than username, password and contact email, no private infomation (addreses, phone, etc) is held by the system.

## Generates management dashboards and balanced scorecards

Imperative is that such a system faciliates Super Users to very quickly verify large amounts of data and enable users to correct errors. Cluster Status and Master Status screens allow Super Users to drill down into the original source data to verify and re-set erroneous data.
