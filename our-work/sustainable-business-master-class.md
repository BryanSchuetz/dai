The Local Content Masterclass brings together participants from the private
and public sector, helping them balance the commercial realities of volatile global
demand and sustained cost pressures with the current political momentum for increased
local content. DAI draws on more than 2,000 long-term projects and development assignments
completed across 150 countries to advance participants’ skills.
