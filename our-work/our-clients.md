National and local governments, bilateral and multilateral donors, private corporations and philanthropies—our clients have ambitious objectives in demanding environments. We work with change-agents all over the world to help turn their investments into impact. Some of our biggest clients include:

## U.S. Agency for International Development

In 1973, we won our first contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to analyze 36 projects in Latin America and Africa. Since then, our engagement with USAID has grown as we tackle fundamental problems caused by inefficient markets, ineffective governments, and instability, bringing together fresh combinations of expertise and innovation across multiple sectors.

## European Commission

Our work with the European Commission is currently managed from the United Kingdom. DAI supports the vision of the Europe 2020 strategy, and is excellently placed to assist the European Union’s efforts toward a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy to deliver high levels of employment, productivity, and social cohesion.
