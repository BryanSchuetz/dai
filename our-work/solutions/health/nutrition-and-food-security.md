We build bridges between nutrition, agriculture, and food security. We are at the forefront of improving nutrition and food security outcomes through our integrated and diverse agriculture, agribusiness, and livelihoods programs. We are developing sustainable market- and community-based solutions for improving maternal and child nutrition.

Our tailored approach in food-insecure countries strengthens the capabilities of all actors along the chain to realize improvements in input supply, production, post-harvest handling, and food processing, typically with a focus on value chain development for crops with the best chance of improving nutrition and food security.
We use value chain analysis to identify food-based and other constraints to improving the stubbornly high prevalence of malnutrition in many developing countries, especially among young children who represent countries’ futures.
