Health and livelihoods are inextricably linked. Communities and households facing significant health challenges often face food and livelihood insecurity. Livelihoods and food security limitations undermine health, perpetuate vulnerability, and exacerbate social stigma, especially for women, vulnerable children, and persons living with HIV/AIDS.

There is growing evidence indicating that sustained improvements in health among chronically ill members of these groups require sustained investments in both health and livelihoods. Our global health and livelihoods work spans all sectors and engages families, community leaders, nongovernmental groups, schools, governments, health and agriculture workers, and the private sector to foster resilience, expand economic opportunity, and improve health outcomes.
