Creating institutionalized mechanisms for public participation creates space for the negotiation and inclusive political settlements necessary to provide all citizens with access to government services. We work with governments and citizens on formal and informal mechanisms to enhance the accountability of service providers. Our work in this area includes building civil societyâ€™s ability to use accountability tools such as social audits and community scorecards, working with government institutions to strengthen internal controls, and supporting strong parliamentary oversight of public expenditures and policy implementation.
