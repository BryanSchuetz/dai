Responsive and effective elected bodies are the foundation of good governance. Our legislative strengthening practice builds the capacity of lawmakers at the national and subnational level to formulate effective legislation responsive to the needs of citizens. By supporting the research, constituent outreach, and oversight functions of legislatures, we are laying the groundwork for effective rule of law in the many countries where we work. Our work with legislatures also seeks to find forums for civil society inclusion in the legislative process, both to provide inputs into policy deliberations and to hold elected representatives accountable.
