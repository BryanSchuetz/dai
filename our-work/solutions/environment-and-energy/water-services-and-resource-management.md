One of the pillars for inclusive and sustainable economic growth is nationwide access to water resources. Reflecting the centrality of water to human development and prosperity, our specialists help national and local governments and private companies devise and carry out plans to improve water security, water productivity, and expanded access to clean water and sanitation service solutions so our solutions are designed to:

* Improve management of water resources in freshwater-scarce regions with expanding populations that face additional vulnerabilities of climate change.
* Improve water productivity in agriculture through assistance and capacity building to farmers challenged with meeting their nation’s food security needs.
* Forge cross-border partnerships to develop legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for transnational river basin management, a keystone for regional mitigation of water scarcity, alleviation of poverty, provision of food security, protection of ecosystems, and advancement of livelihoods.
* Achieve public health goals by extending clean water and sanitation infrastructure—innovatively financed by credit guarantees and partnerships between utilities and financial institutions—especially in rapidly growing urban areas that are the engines of economic growth for many countries.
