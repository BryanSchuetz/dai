We support low-emissions development through policy design at the national and local levels to change practices and drive investment in clean and renewable energy and energy-efficiency technology. With a focus on expanding cleaner energy access for the 2.4 billion people who rely on traditional biomass and expensive fuels, DAI supports governments at the national and regional levels in their design of energy, trade, and tax policies, as well as at the local level for urban development and environmental policies. We work to build an environment in which stakeholders are able to attract investment for wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass, and efficient fossil-based energy for both grid and off-grid distributed electricity. By evaluating energy needs in value chains including agriculture, we identify and address barriers to deploying clean and affordable technology, such as efficient water pumps and steam traps. In communities, we help local populations match the right technologies with local conditions and use resources more efficiently through new business models and public-private partnerships to support improved livelihoods, meet social needs including education, and improve health.
