After graduating from Yale with a degree in Russian studies, Sarah became a Soviet analyst, publishing on health and social issues in the former Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union fell apart, Sarah packed two suitcases, sold all her remaining belongings, and moved to Kazakhstan to work on small-scale privatization. Thus began her career in international development.
