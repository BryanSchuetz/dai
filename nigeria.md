summary: Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and largest economy, a country of
  almost unimaginable promise, but like many emerging nations they face the development
  challenges that come with industrialization and growth. As development professionals,
  we see in Nigeria a fertile opportunity to make an enormous difference in people’s
  lives.

# Women for Health in Nigeria

<div class="infographic">
  <script id="infogram_0_90f68290-7bc4-43d7-a3d8-702791e146a5" title="Distribution of Healthcare Workers in Nigeria" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?Rsd" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>

Northern Nigeria suffers from critical health sector human resource challenges. Up to 90 percent of women deliver their babies without a skilled birth attendant present in northern Nigeria, compared to 35 percent of women in the southern region of the country. And in Jigawa state, there are only five nurses per 100,000 people, compared to Enugu state in the Southeast with 59 per 100,000 people. 

We're helping the U.K. Department for International Development [tackle this problem](/our-work/projects/nigeria-women-for-health-w4h) by empowering women as service providers in five states in northern Nigeria. Since November 2012, W4H has increased the number and capacity of female health workers in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara, while at the same time contributed to women’s empowerment and gender equality in communities and institutions in the northern region.

It is expected that the increased numbers of female health workers will lead to an improvement in women’s access to and use of health services in northern Nigeria and improve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

# Accountable, Responsive, and Capable Government

Inefficient resource management, corruption, and a lack of accountability have undermined Nigeria's ability to translate economic progress into inclusive growth and improved public services for more Nigerians. Advancements in public administration, public financial management, and enhanced policy are crucial in helping the Nigerian government provide better services to its citizens and reduce high levels of poverty.

To promote progress in these key areas, we're [helping the Nigerian government](/our-work/projects/nigeria-state-partnership-accountability-responsiveness-and-capability-sparc) to more effectively manage resources and provide more responsive and accountable services to its citizens. ARC works at both the state and national levels to build on the success of its predecessor program, the State Partnership for Accountability Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC). Over seven years, SPARC helped to support responsive policy formulation and encourage performance-focused public service in Nigeria by helping state governments to improve revenue collection, reduce budgetary waste, and implement strategies for locally led planning.

# Market Systems and Modern Slavery: Reducing poverty and human trafficking in Nigeria

<div class="infographic">

Despite having the largest economy in Africa, around half of Nigeria’s population still lives in extreme poverty. A few hundred miles east of the new skyscrapers and shopping malls of Nigeria’s commercial capital of Lagos, the Niger Delta—made up of nine oil-producing states and home to more than 31 million people—defines the country’s stark contrast in living conditions. Even though it is a major oil-producing region, much of the Delta’s population lives in remote villages and survives on subsistence farming. Exacerbating this poverty is a lack of modern agricultural equipment and supplies that farmers need to improve crop yields, as well as limited access to markets in which to sell their harvests.

The [Market Development in the Niger Delta Project (MADE)](/our-work/projects/nigeria-market-development-programme-made) is promoting inclusive, pro-poor growth for farmers and entrepreneurs. This market systems development approach will help address the root causes of outward migration that have led thousands to fall victim to human traffickers in Libya and Europe. By connecting vulnerable populations with desirable and well-paying jobs at home, MADE aims to reduce the number of Nigerians who attempt to migrate work abroad only to end up trapped in modern slavery.
