# Empowering Women to Serve as Nurses and Midwives

<div class="infographic">
  <script id="infogram_0_90f68290-7bc4-43d7-a3d8-702791e146a5" title="Distribution of Healthcare Workers in Nigeria" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?Rsd" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>

Northern Nigeria suffers from critical human resource challenges in the health sector. Up to 90 percent of women deliver their babies without a skilled birth attendant present, compared to 35 percent of women in the southern region of the country. Jigawa state, for example, has only five nurses per 100,000 people, compared to Enugu state in the Southeast with 59 per 100,000 women. 

The [Women for Health (W4H) project](/our-work/projects/nigeria-women-for-health-w4h) is working to tackle this problem by empowering women as service providers in five states in northern Nigeria. Since November 2012, W4H has increased the number and capacity of female health workers in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Yobe, and Zamfara, while at the same time contributing to women’s empowerment and gender equality in communities and institutions in the region.

W4H works closely with other existing health and education programs in the states to use a “building back better” approach in the conflic`t- and humanitarian emergency- affected areas in Borno and Yobe states, and ensure sustainability of the progress achieved over the last five years in Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, and Zamfara.

# Accountable, Responsive, and Capable Government

<div class="infographic">

</div>

Inefficient resource management, corruption, and a lack of accountability have undermined Nigeria's ability to translate economic progress into inclusive growth and improved public services. Advancements in public administration, public financial management, and enhanced policy are crucial in helping the Nigerian government provide better services to its citizens and reduce poverty.

DAI is assisting [the Nigerian government](/our-work/projects/nigeria-state-partnership-accountability-responsiveness-and-capability-sparc) to more effectively manage resources and provide more responsive and accountable services. The Accountable, Responsive, and Capable Government project works at both the state and national levels to build on the success of its predecessor program, the State Partnership for Accountability Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC). Over seven years, SPARC supported responsive policy formulation and performance-focused public service in Nigeria by helping state governments to improve revenue collection, reduce budgetary waste, and implement led planning.

# Supporting Market Systems to Reduce Poverty and Human Trafficking

<div class="infographic">
<script id="infogram_0_a72fe19a-ad10-4eaa-ae8f-636b35a5903f" title="Nigerian Poverty Rate" src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?tge" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>

Despite having the largest economy in Africa, around half of Nigeria’s population still lives in poverty. The [Market Development in the Niger Delta Project (MADE)](/our-work/projects/nigeria-market-development-programme-made) is promoting inclusive, pro-poor growth for farmers and entrepreneurs. At the same time, this market systems development approach will help address the root causes of outward migration that have led thousands to fall victim to human traffickers in Libya and Europe. By connecting vulnerable populations with desirable jobs at home, MADE aims to reduce the number of Nigerians who attempt to migrate work abroad only to end up trapped in modern slavery.
