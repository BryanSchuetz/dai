summary: 'The novel coronavirus has had a profound public health impact in the developed
  world and is poised to have an equally if not more devastating effect on developing
  nations. As travel bans, lockdowns, and stalled trade take an increasing toll, economic
  spillover effects—and associated social instability—threaten to compound the crisis,
  especially in some of the world’s more vulnerable and fragile states.

# Economic and Social Recovery

DAI offers a comprehensive suite of economic and social recovery services to support our partners in the fight against COVID-19.

* **PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT**: Ensuring governments have the financial infrastructure and policies in place to define and execute an effective response to COVID-19, enabling them to mobilize and direct resources to critical health, economic, and social priorities.
* **GOVERNMENT CAPACITY BUILDING AND SUPPORT**: Integrating pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery into national, subnational, and local government planning, with an emphasis on assisting municipal authorities on the frontlines of COVID-19 response.
* **FINANCIAL ADVISORY**: Counseling and assisting governments, central banks, and financial institutions in their efforts to maintain liquidity in stricken economies, including through digital finance. 
* **WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE (WASH)**: Raising hygiene awareness, building the capacity of water utilities, supporting WASH entrepreneurs, and developing the WASH infrastructure essential to combatting COVID-19.
* **SUPPLY CHAINS AND MARKET SYSTEMS**: Revising and executing competitiveness and viability strategies in agricultural and other supply chains, and bolstering resilience in market systems—especially food systems—to drive interventions that keep markets alive and populations healthy.
* **EDUCATION**: Supporting ministries of education in both low/no-tech and higher-tech settings to assess and implement continuity-of-learning strategies.
* **STRATEGIC AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE COMMUNICATION**: Across sectors, designing and executing awareness campaigns at the government, value chain, institution, or business level to mitigate disease spread and pave the way for recovery.
* **GENDER AND SOCIAL INCLUSION**: Addressing gender norms, roles, and other social factors influencing vulnerability to infection, exposure to pathogens, and treatments received, and how these may differ among women and men and other vulnerable populations.
