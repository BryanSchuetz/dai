## Fix List

### Navigation
* Have the navigation in the footer and the header generated programatically
* Switch from using nth-child declarations to using straight classes so that the responsive adjustments carry down past IE9
* 

### Parking-lot of annoying issues
* will need to figure out re-directs if hosting on GH-Pages
  * Particularly for /news formerly /news-and-publications (an important url to maintain)
  * Possibly can create an empy page with a Jscript redirect, this won't impart Google Juice though
    * Maybe build a 301 redirect page with Jekyll
