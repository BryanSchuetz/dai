We are delighted to announce that DAI has been awarded the Project Payasages Resilients—Nord/Haiti Resilient Environment—North (HRE-N) Activity. HRE-N is a five-year initiative to strengthen communities, local systems, and climate resilience in Haiti’s Northern Resilience Focus Zone; it will protect and restore ecosystem services using a watershed management approach that fosters sustainable productivity—through interventions such as enhanced agroforestry and soil conservation techniques—and economic inclusion. 

The activity will strengthen a range of integrated resilience capacities to build and protect productive assets and investments in the environment, sustainable livelihoods, social cohesion, and local systems. Combining shock-response approaches, risk mitigation, coordination with local early warning and response mechanisms, and long-term adaptation strategies, the activity will take a holistic approach to Haiti’s many challenges, which include climate change and extreme weather events, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of other diseases, the resurgence of conflict and violence, and generally weak governance and systems.", "completion": "In northern Haiti, the Bahon, Joli Trou, and Les Perches sub-watersheds provide critical ecosystem services for local communities. Water availability, erosion control, and forested watersheds are particularly important for the sustainability of crop and livestock production on which these communities rely for income, food security, and resilience to shocks and stressors. While many households in these sub-watersheds are aware of improved natural resource management (NRM) practices and technologies, a majority live in poverty and lack the time, resources, and finances to utilize these practices in a consistent or scalable manner. With drought and increasingly intense natural disasters brought on by climate change, prioritizing the ecological health of the sub-watersheds is even more imperative.

To help address these issues, the U.S. Agency for International Development designed the Haiti Resilient Environment North (HRE-N) Activity, to build communities’ resilience to reduce chronic vulnerability and facilitate inclusive growth. Despite a challenging context, HRE-N, or Projet Paysages Resilients in French, represents an opportunity to support shifts in watershed management practices across households, communities, and sub-watersheds.

By systematically fostering local ownership and identifying incentives through regular engagement with stakeholders, our watershed management approach will align economic incentives with improved NRM practices. By combining this with improved organizational and technical capacity of communities and stakeholder groups, our approach ensures that HRE-N will leave behind more self-reliant local actors and interventions that lead to long-lasting change.

In 2021, unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The confluence of the pandemic and recurrent economic crisis has caused municipal revenues to decline sharply.

Mayors and municipal councilors, as the face of government accountability and public spending, assume outsized responsibility for government performance. However, with limited authority, these officials are not empowered to make decisions and set funding priorities. Many municipalities have the basic building blocks needed to strengthen services and pursue local economic development but lack the organizational culture required to apply them effectively. Recognizing that municipalities should serve as convenors, enablers, and facilitators of local economic development, mayors and municipal councilors must partner with the private sector and remove bureaucratic obstacles to investment, job creation, and local economic growth.

Estimated Revenue: $1 million

We are pleased to report that USAID has awarded the Central Asia Support for Stable Societies (CASSS) Project a costed six-month extension focused on examining the regional implications of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.

Following the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces in August 2021, regional dynamics will likely shift at a rapid pace, raising new questions about the evolution of violent extremism in Central Asia—including whether the Taliban takeover will inspire domestic extremists, prompt a new wave of Central Asian foreign fighters to mobilize, and/or produce spillover conflict effects in neighboring states. 

To examine these and related issues, CASSS will draw on capabilities, knowledge, and partnerships developed during the research design and implementation phases of the program, in addition to the contextual and technical expertise DAI has in both Central Asia and Afghanistan. CASSS will tap the expertise of trusted partner Oxus Society and the DAI-implemented Competitiveness, Trade, and Jobs program to implement a mixed-methodology research framework to address various critical questions identified by USAID. For example, we will analyze the implications of the Afghan crisis for Central Asian stakeholders including local civil society organizations (CSOs), local government counterparts, USAID, other parts of the U.S. Government, and, if possible, the wider donor community.
", "completion": "The Central Asia Support for Stable Societies (CASSS) activity identified and tested new methods for the prevention of violent extremism in Central Asia. The activity conducted field and digital research to identify risk and prevention factors for violent extremism. Based on the research results, the activity worked closely with civil society organizations (CSOs) in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to design and test developing evidence-based, practical approaches that broadened understandings of how to address violent extremism risk reduction pilot programming.

CASSS applied a public health model to research, design, pilot, and evaluate CVE programming across digital and real-world environments, in collaboration with the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Through CASSS, the team came to understand how violent extremism dynamics are changing and what evidence-based interventions will be most effective in addressing violent extremism.

Based on that understanding, the Countering Violent Extremism in Central Asia Activity (CVECA), which began in 2022, empowers and capacitates individuals, families, and communities to navigate the violent extremist threat as it evolves across five countries in Central Asia.

CVECA assists hotspot communities to build resilient ecosystems that reduce risk and enhance protection against violent extremism. This assistance includes building legacy networks of women leaders with the skills and standing to lead change, academics, and organizations with enhanced capacity to analyze shifting threats and communities with systems of inclusion that promote social cohesion inclusive of marginalized populations.

We are delighted to report that DAI has been awarded the Youth Resilience to Crime and Violence in the Caribbean Activity, a five-year effort to improve youth, family, and community resilience to crime and violence across 20 communities in Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 

The Activity will partner with youth, government officials, community leaders, service providers, and the private sector to create an enabling environment that supports and empowers young people. Together, the Activity and its partners will improve social service delivery; strengthen education, market-relevant skills, and psychosocial support; facilitate access to productive and income-generating opportunities with strategic private sector engagement; and foster strong community and family systems. The Activity will emphasize knowledge management and learning to ensure that tools, evidence, and best practices are shared throughout the Eastern and Southern Caribbean region.

Of the top 20 countries in the world with the highest murder rates, 17 are in Latin America and the Caribbean. These incidents of crime and violence disproportionately affect young people, between 15 and 29, and remain a major social problem. Young males are most at risk of becoming both victims and perpetrators of crime in the region.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Youth Resilience, Inclusion &amp; Empowerment in the Caribbean Activity—in Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia, and one additional Caribbean country—to address this demand and support youth to build more safe, prosperous, and resilient societies.

The project works to improve the provision of social services to vulnerable populations, provides targeted education, psychosocial support, and market-relevant skills to youth, improves access to productive and inclusive development opportunities for youth, and supports family and community interventions. Because a major impediment to youth resilience to crime and violence is the lack of a strong social support system, the project also focuses on strengthening family and community systems to improve support to youth and create safer communities. Because there is a high incidence of gender-based violence in the Caribbean, the program prioritizes engaging men and boys to address behaviors and norms that rationalize and contribute to high levels of gender-based violence. It also prioritizes referral, recovery, and livelihoods for girls and young women who are survivors and trafficking victims.

KSPP aims to strengthen the public procurement system in Kosovo to reduce incidents of malfeasance and corruption. It will improve practices implemented by contracting authorities, as well as working with the Procurement Review Body (PRB)—a decision making panel—to ensure professional and fair adjudication of procurement disputes.

The project's main objectives are to:

Ensure that the PRB is well governed and accountable, maximising the potential of each employee.

Digitalise the case management system to ensure a more impartial, transparent, and accountable review process, improving the quality of decisions and reducing the risk of corruption.

Ensure that PRB decisions are sound, clearly reasoned, and consistent with previously adjudicated cases.

Strengthen the procurement systems of three targeted contracting authorities to ensure a level playing field and prevent irregularities and corruption.", "completion": "Public procurement is a government tool used to deliver goods and services such as fixing roads, building schools, or buying medical equipment for citizens. Fair competition, a level playing field, and transparency are essential to ensuring public money is spent responsibly and leads to the best value for citizens in terms of high-quality goods and services.

However, in Kosovo, citizens, civil society organizations, and private sector economic operators report that public procurement had been compromised by political patronage, nepotism, fraud, and other forms of corruption. This problem reduces public resources available for service delivery to citizens, undermines public confidence in government, and deters foreign investment. It is critically important for the Government of Kosovo to address these weaknesses or gaps in the procurement system, especially at the municipal level, to safeguard public money spent through public procurement.

To assist the Government of Kosovo in strengthening systems and limit opportunities for fraud, waste, or abuse in public procurement, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Transparent, Effective, and Accountable Municipalities (USAID TEAM) activity, which DAI implemented from 2016 to 2022. The project supported Kosovo to improve the transparency and accountability of the municipal procurement process in all 38 municipalities. At the central level, USAID TEAM worked with institutions that oversee public procurement, supervise municipal internal auditors, manage the municipal budgeting process, and oversee anti-corruption investigations. In addition, USAID TEAM built the capacity of civil society organizations to exercise citizen oversight municipal procurement in a watchdog role and to provide checks and balances by exposing corrupt practices and working with citizens and local governments as a partner in the process of procurement modernization.

Building off that project, the Municipal Integrity Activity is working with central government oversight agencies, municipalities, and civil society, media, and private sector actors to advance reform in public procurement, with a renewed emphasis on budget planning, contract management, audit, integrity, and private sector engagement.

Customer: USAID
Contract Date: September 2022
Period of Performance: Five years
Estimated Revenue: $48 million

We are thrilled to report that USAID has awarded DAI its Honduras Building Climate Resilience Activity. As climate change stresses the forests of Honduras and renders them more susceptible to threats such as insects and wildfires, simultaneous threats from deforestation and degradation—driven by agricultural expansion and extractive activity—exert even more pressure on those same forests. Meanwhile, shifting precipitation patterns, including worsening drought and stronger tropical cyclones, are altering the hydrology of key watersheds. This vicious cycle compounds longstanding poverty, marginalization, and food insecurity; erodes community cohesion, further stressing already weak local systems and contributing to high rates of internal and outward migration; and limits opportunities for young people to build their futures in Honduras. 

Led by Chief of Party Sergio Claure, the Building Climate Resilience Activity will support Honduran actors and Honduran systems at the national, watershed, basin, and community levels to develop the inclusive governance, local capacity, and resources they need to withstand and respond to climate change, and build the resilience that will allow all Hondurans to move forward into a more climate-secure future.", "completion": "In Honduras, climate change exacerbates extreme weather events and shocks such as cyclones, forest fires, and drought. These shocks threaten Honduran ecosystems, worsen food insecurity, and contribute to water scarcity. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and back-to-back tropical storms, combined with consecutive years of below-average rainfall, have decimated the Honduran economy, hampering poverty reduction efforts, provoking social unrest, and driving irregular migration.

In the face of these unprecedented challenges, Hondurans need new approaches to build resilience that will enable them to thrive—where they are.

The Building Climate Resilience Activity strengthens the capacity of Honduran systems to respond to climate change, which will help to address underlying factors that contribute to irregular migration. The Activity collaborates with local communities, government officials, nongovernmental groups, and businesses to improve equitable, inclusive, and transparent water resources management; conserve critical ecosystems; and manage climate risk.

The confluence of two rivers, for example, is frequently the site of Hindu temples with spiritual significance.

Despite the critical importance of Nepal’s ecosystems, exploitation and environmental degradation continues at an unrelenting rate. Sand mining in rivers degrades freshwater habitats and increases flood risk. Climate change exacerbates these threats, intensifying risks from floods and droughts while affecting food security, agricultural productivity, migration patterns, and disaster risk.

The U.S. Government’s New Silk Road Initiative is supporting Central Asia to regain its place at the center of renewed trade between the East and West. An integral part of the initiative is the Trade Central Asia (TCA) activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and working in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to improve the region’s trade environment, resulting in growth for exports and increased employment.

DAI’s strategy focuses on facilitating the development of competitive, inclusive market systems in the region while ensuring that activities are demand-driven and locally led to increase sustainability. TCA promotes growth in the agricultural, transport, and logistics sectors by leveraging other USAID investments in the region, including two DAI-managed activities: Uzbekistan Agricultural Value Chains and Pakistan Regional Economic Integration Activity.

By 2026, we anticipate that the activity will have reduced the average time to move goods by road from Afghanistan to Kazakhstan by more than 25 percent, and that more accessible sources of information, better networking opportunities, and strengthened trade promotion service providers will generate more than $100 million in new cross-border sales.

Yet, Egypt’s economic governance reforms must be broader and deeper if it is to achieve its development vision of improving public welfare by creating enough quality jobs to meet the massive demographic challenge it now faces. The reforms must strengthen a weak institutional framework and begin to reverse socioeconomic inequities.

The Egypt Economic Governance Activity (EGA) works with the government to support the country’s investment climate by strengthening inclusive governance and supporting the government’s structural reform program.

EGA assists with Egypt’s economic and good governance reforms by:

Supporting the reform process.

Building capacity in public administration, including rolling out anticorruption training across the government at all levels of the civil service.

Improving local service delivery, with an emphasis on innovative e-governance.

Together, these efforts should increase participation and inclusion in Egypt’s governance reforms, enhance the transparency and accountability of government services, improve government effectiveness, and combat corruption—all of which will boost Egypt’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. DAI’s “sustainable reform” approach to EGA promotes multilevel sustainability by applying a nuanced understanding of the political economy and a management stance that supports government actors from behind the scenes.

With high levels of violence and organized crime, and more than 30,000 homicides in 2019 alone, it is imperative that Mexican justice sector actors and citizens work together to make their communities safer and to ensure the rule of law is enforced. While the challenges are immense, there are opportunities as some states have shown a commitment to advancing the justice reform process and are eager to make progress toward reducing impunity and improving trust in their state-level institutions.

The Programa para el Fortalecimiento de Instituciones de Justicia Penal Estatal (ConJusticia) consolidates and sustains recent justice system reforms by supporting state-level attorneys general offices and justice courts, with an emphasis on promoting collaboration and durable partnerships between these entities and other justice sector and local actors. These mutually supportive partnerships will enhance Mexico’s capacity to prosecute high-priority crimes—including high-impact and serious crimes—and reduce impunity.

Alongside our subcontractors Fortis, Rapid Results Institute, and the Metropolitan Group, DAI is ensuring that ConJusticia works with engaged, committed local partners, adapting our assistance to their particular needs as those needs change over time. In consultation with these state-level justice actors and community stakeholders, we will define project interventions that are responsive to their level of capacity and in line with their political will so that ConJusticia’s activities are more likely to be viable, locally owned, and sustainable.

After five years, ConJusticia, in close coordination with other U.S. Agency for International Development activities, will deliver a marked improvement in prosecution rates of high-level, serious, and high-priority crimes that will result in improved citizen perceptions regarding the justice sector’s ability to address crime and violence and protect the most vulnerable.

The Technical Assistance in Support of Trade and Development for the Promove Comércio programme works to improve the trade and business environment in Mozambique. It is part of a wider partnership—the Promove Comércio programme—between the Government of Mozambique and the European Union. Our work falls under two of three components.

DAI works with the Ministry of Industry and Trade to improve government coordination and the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and the World Trade Organization’s trade facilitation agreement reforms. By reaching effective implementation of EPA provisions, importers will be able to benefit from reduced import duty on European Union products, while exporters will be able to benefit from opportunities from applying rules of origin which will lead to added value on exports from Mozambique to the European Union.

"}{"prompt": "", "completion": "Current water security challenges facing the Philippine archipelago include burgeoning populations, unsustainable land uses, and deficient wastewater services. At the center of the challenges is water—a steady, dependable supply is increasingly elusive in many parts of the country as flows oscillate between too much or too little. Unfortunately, such adversities will only increase in the face of climate change, which is expected to further exacerbate ecological imbalances as climate variability becomes the new normal.

The Safe Water activity provides Philippine local government units, water service providers, and watershed councils in target provinces with the information, incentives, and partnerships they require to identify and address barriers to a water-secure future—yielding life-saving gains in access to water supply and sanitation services for unserved and underserved households in the Philippines’ most water-stressed communities.

By applying a systems approach that strengthens linkages between upstream and downstream stakeholders in the Negros Occidental and Sarangani and Palawan Provinces, Safe Water works to: increase access to resilient water supply and sanitation services; improve sustainable management of water resources; and strengthen water sector governance.

The activity is expected to strengthen services for some 1.1 million Filipinos.

"}{"prompt": "", "completion": "Nepal is prone to a range of natural disasters, including floods, landslides, fires, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks. In the wake of recent tragedies in the country, including the massive 2015 Gorkha earthquake, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has established a flagship disaster preparedness and response program for Nepal.

Tayar—which means “prepare”—strengthens the capacity of Nepal’s disaster risk management and preparedness institutions. At the national level, the project supports national agencies, including the newly created National Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Agency (NDRRMA), to conduct national disaster simulations, improve disaster response technologies, and establish a National Disaster Training Academy. Locally, Tayar works with urban municipalities to develop risk-sensitive land use plans that increase disaster resilience. This local support includes technical assistance activities such as slope stabilization, humanitarian open spaces, and building retrofitting to reduce disaster risk.

In the event of a disaster during the course of the project, Tayar will engage the program’s rapid emergency response mechanism. The team will work closely with the Government of Nepal and Nepali emergency responders to mobilize technical assistance, commodity support, small-scale infrastructure, and information management support. Through its Stronger Systems + Safer Settlements Approach, Tayar will apply lessons learned from disaster response efforts to improve national systems and municipal risk-reduction activities.
