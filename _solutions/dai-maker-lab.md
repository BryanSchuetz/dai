Recent years have seen the emergence of tools and approaches that are radically lowering barriers to designing and fabricating sophisticated electronic and mechanical hardware. More accessible microcontrollers are democratizing the design and implementation of embedded electronics. The current generation of digital fabrication tools enables affordable desktop factories that can produce precision parts in a variety of materials, without an overwhelming training burden. Collaborative workspaces provide access to tools and training to people without major up-front costs. Open source cultural and legal frameworks mean that innovators have access to cutting-edge approaches and techniques without building mountains of intellectual property on their own. These are powerful new tools for applying hardware to problems.

For developing countries, distant in every way from the traditional ecosystems for producing hardware, this is potentially transformative. The DAI Maker Lab uses these new tools and [approaches](https://prezi.com/pxbdaizrkbrf/diy-development/) to build hardware and build capacities around hardware in support of the projects we implement around the world. Some representative examples include:

##  Flood Early Warning for Cambodia
Working with a nongovernmental organization called People In Need under our [Cambodia Development Innovations](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations) project, the DAI Maker Lab designed a sonar stream gauge called [Tepmachcha](https://github.com/DAI-Maker-Lab/tepmachcha) for flood detection in vulnerable areas. This $300 device triggers People In Need's interactive voice response (IVR) system to send warning calls to thousands of downstream users within minutes of detecting a flood condition. Because few phones feature adequate Khmer language support, this audio warning call is effective where SMS warnings would fall short. This idiosyncratic local need was far too niche to be met by commercial manufacturers, but the DAI Maker Lab was able to work with People In Need to design a device that worked with the API of its RapidPro IVR system and to train its staff to build, maintain, and extend the design. With a further grant from the Development Innovations project, People In Need has since built nine more units to extend the flood warning network across the country.

## Empowering Water Utilities—and Local Entrepreneurs—in Indonesia
The [Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (IUWASH) Plus](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-urban-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-iuwash) project works with small water utilities to build their technical and administrative capacities to provide quality service. Real-time data about parameters such as water pressure can be a powerful tool for utilities to operate their distribution networks more effectively, but commercial hardware is too expensive for most Indonesian utilities, and local support is unavailable. With the support of IUWASH Plus and the DAI Maker Lab, Jakarta makerspace Makedonia is working with local innovators to engage utilities in a user-centered design process around water pressure telemetry hardware. Once testing and iterative prototyping yields a final design, IUWASH Plus will issue the first commercial contracts for deploying the units. Rather than procuring expensive and unsustainable commercial hardware, the project will create a local private sector ecosystem that can meet the need with locally appropriate devices.


##  Development Equipment

The conundrum is as old as development work: certain capacities cannot be built without access to specialized equipment. But because that equipment is rarely designed with developing country environments in mind, failures are more common than successes. Locally inappropriate design, electrical problems, lack of repair personnel, and other problems mean that success rates with these equipment installations are dispiritingly low.

Thanks to tools and approaches developed within the maker movement, we now have an alternative. Stakeholders can be actively engaged in a user-centered design process for their own equipment. This equipment can be prototyped, tested, and iterated in the context that it will be used. And it can be built, repaired, and extended by beneficiaries who have been provided with the tools, open source hardware and software, and knowledge to do so. By pioneering this user-centered design paradigm, the DAI Maker Lab is [allowing development projects][2] to leave beneficiaries with truly appropriate equipment that can genuinely belong to them in a way never before possible.

##  Maker Spaces

DAI is integrating collaborative workshops, known as makerspaces, into its programming in key technical areas. By giving local populations access to the tools, knowledge, and opportunity to develop their own solutions to local problems, we create tremendous opportunities for economic, youth, and workforce development, and empower communities to apply a new kind of hyperlocal technology to the challenges they face.
