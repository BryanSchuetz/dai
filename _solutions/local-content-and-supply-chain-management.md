The [Sustainable Business Group](/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) builds in-house programs or develops multistakeholder, industry-wide solutions that will create a sustainable industrial base without losing sight of immediate business needs. Our approach begins with a discussion of business objectives, procurement needs, and community expectations, and includes target-setting, stakeholder engagement, measurement and evaluation, and communications. We help clients determine if and how to engage other operators, contractors, governments, and communities in the program. We can focus our services to meet particular needs or build directories that broaden suppliersâ€™ markets, thereby improving their abilities to thrive and to support procurement needs.

* We  work closely with clients to deploy our **Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM)**, which forecasts local content capacity based on detailed analysis of the demand side of investments and the supply-side capabilities of the local supplier and labor markets.
* We offer a **Supplier Registration and Pre-Qualification portal (SRPQ)** that matches local suppliers with buyers (operators and primary contractors) and helps foreign suppliers form alliances with local vendors to access protected local markets.  
* We provide regulators and companies with our [Local Content Plan and Reporting platform (LCPR)](/our-work/local-content-plan-and-report), which is configured to domestic regulations and assures companies meet their obligations to comply with local content, contract tendering, and reporting requirements. [Read the brochure](/uploads/lcpr-final.pdf).   
* We deliver the established **LCS Local Content Master Class** in Africa, Middle East, Americas and Asia. We also provide confidential advisory services to governments and companies on local content regulation, the development of local content plans, and the drafting and execution of contract documents to leverage local content within major contract tenders.
