Peace-building and state-building are fundamentally “endogenous” political processes, meaning that local people will drive the ultimate outcome. As an external partner, we help them succeed by enhancing broad participation in the transition, providing financial and technical assistance, and promoting best-fit approaches.

Because constructive state-society relations are critical to building legitimate states that deliver for their citizens and promote long-term peace, we support solutions that empower the state, when appropriate, and encourage state-society relations. We work with local partners to achieve five interrelated objectives that strengthen state-society relations:

* addressing the root causes of violent conflict
* supporting local conflict management mechanisms
* promoting inclusive political processes
* improving the core functions of responsible states
* responding to public expectations and needs

Our work depends upon the level of fragility that prevails within the state and its institutions—ranging from corruption and deteriorating governance to ongoing violent conflict, post-conflict or political transition, and gradual improvement.
