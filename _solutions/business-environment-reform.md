We have deep experience in reforming business environments to improve competitiveness of companies, industries, and countries in domestic and global markets.

Using top-down and bottom-up approaches, we lower transaction costs, simplify regulations, and develop necessary laws and regulations to reduce informality, increase employment and investment, and access markets. We work with governments to strengthen their ability to develop and implement laws and regulations that support competitiveness, and streamline regulations already on the books. In the private sector, we support firms and other industry stakeholders to be effective partners in promoting systemic change.
