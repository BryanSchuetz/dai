Since 1985, DAI has been a leader in expanding [financial inclusion](http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/financial-inclusion/), enterprise finance and mobilizing capital for development priorities around the world. Our proven track record extends across several clients—including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Financial Corporation, the U.K. Department for International Development, World Bank, European Investment Bank, and the U.S. Agency for International Development—for whom we have led some of the most innovative financial services programs. 

DAI has supported the [transformation and privatization](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mongolia-khan-bank-bank-management-support) of two major banks; built the capacity of and designed tools and systems for financial institutions; partnered with mobile network operators to expand digital financial services; promoted the expansion of savings groups to marginalized populations; facilitated investment for growing businesses; worked with central banks for improved financial sector policy, regulation and supervision; and championed initiatives in knowledge management and advocacy. 

Our financial services work typically complements DAI’s capacity in trade, competitiveness, and value chain development in sectors with potential for enhanced sales, job generation, and engagement of small producers and enterprises. Our work enables also MSMEs to address their managerial, planning, marketing and other limitations which constrains their ability to raise and absorb capital. 




By tailoring financial products and services to the needs of the [low-income market segment](http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/financial-inclusion/), small and medium-sized enterprises, and high-priority sectors such as agriculture, our financial services specialists develop innovative, [technology-driven solutions](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/benefits-of-bringing-mobile-banking-to-the-unbanked/) that accelerate enterprise and industry expansion.

We also structure international funds that address broader development challenges with longer-term financing requirements such as water resources management, energy efficiency, infrastructure, and utility upgrading. And, we excel at turning around loss-making state-owned banks by expanding services, attracting customers, and vastly increasing profitability and market share.
