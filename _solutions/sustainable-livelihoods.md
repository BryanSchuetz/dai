Environmental protection is no longer the exclusive domain of the public and nonprofit sectors. Operating on behalf of clients in developing countries throughout the globe, we are transforming former hindrances to growth into vehicles for sustainable development. Just as social entrepreneurs are flourishing in the developed world, we are building the capacity of developing-world businessmen and women to adopt triple-bottom-line business models that blend environmental, social, and economic returns.

We help local stakeholders and businesses to devise and carry out innovative solutions using market-based approaches that generate business and livelihood opportunities based on sound environmental stewardship. Working in targeted ecosystems, our specialists help local stakeholders and businesses improve their knowledge of market opportunities and options, market requirements, and the value of products and services they can deliver that are linked to sound environmental management. DAI can help local communities and entrepreneurs access the financing, market information, and technical support required to develop successful businesses based on local products such as honey, resins, and ecotourism, all the while providing strong incentives to preserve important ecosystems.
