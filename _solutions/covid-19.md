<p>As pandemics strike, DAI with our partners are at the forefront of helping countries and communities prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks and their impacts. Our work includes a range of tools and approaches including: advocacy, governance, and public financial management approaches to better allocation of government resources for prevention; planning, surveillance, rapid response, and risk communications tools to reduce transmission; municipal planning tools to support sub-national capacity; regional planning tools with WHO and FAO; and recovery tools to help countries and communities reduce the longer-term impacts of pandemics.
