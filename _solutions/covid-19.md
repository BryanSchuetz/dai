## Global Health Solutions

<p>As pandemics strike, DAI with our partners are at the forefront of helping countries and communities prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks and their impacts. Our work includes a range of tools and approaches including: advocacy, governance, and public financial management approaches to better allocation of government resources for prevention; planning, surveillance, rapid response, and risk communications tools to reduce transmission; municipal planning tools to support sub-national capacity; regional planning tools with WHO and FAO; and recovery tools to help countries and communities reduce the longer-term impacts of pandemics.

Today, DAI is ready to provide technical assistance across projects and directly with governments and the private sector to help our clients prepare for, detect, and respond to disease threats; build International Health Regulation capacities; and work at national and subnational levels to ensure governments, civil society, and the private sector can reduce the impact of COVID-19.

On projects such as Women for Health in Nigeria (W4H), the Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Programme, and Better Health in Mexico, we are pivoting activities to address COVID-19. In Nigeria, for example, we are adding components on community awareness raising, e-training for midwives and health workers, and psychosocial counseling for medical personnel on the frontline. In Indonesia, the USAID Jalin maternal health program is preparing to help health facilities treat pregnant women and newborns with COVID-19 and to educate health workers on the virus. 

Across the entire DAI Global Health portfolio, we are mobilizing to offer comprehensive COVID-19 services. For information on how DAI can support your COVID-19 health response, contact Robert Salerno, U.S. Health Security Lead, or Jeff Mecaskey, U.K. Health Security Lead.
