Since 1985, DAI has been a leader in expanding [financial inclusion](http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/financial-inclusion?utm_source=daidotcom), medium, small, and microenterprise finance, and mobilizing capital for development priorities around the world. Our proven track record extends across several clients—including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Financial Corporation, the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, World Bank, European Investment Bank, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the U.S. Agency for International Development—for whom we have led some of the most [innovative financial services](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/unlocking-capital-across-kenya-how-usaid-firm-pushed-the-frontier-of-financial-services-and-built-a-foundation-for-economic-growth?utm_source=daidotcom), finance, and investment programs.

DAI has supported the [transformation and privatization](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mongolia-khan-bank-bank-management-support) of two major banks; built the capacity of and designed tools and systems for financial institutions; partnered with mobile network operators and fintechs to expand digital finance; promoted the expansion of [savings groups](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/breaking-a-wooden-box-under-a-mango-tree?utm_source=daidotcom) to marginalized populations; facilitated investment for growing businesses; worked with central banks, capital markets and insurance authorities for improved financial sector and markets policy, regulation and supervision; help design and build financial market infrastructure for payments and securities issuance and trading; and championed initiatives in knowledge management and advocacy.
 
Our financial services work typically complements DAI’s capacity in trade, competitiveness, livelihoods, and value chain development in sectors with potential for enhanced sales, job generation, and engagement of small producers and enterprises. Our work enables micro and small enterprises to address managerial, planning, marketing, and other limitations that constrain their ability to raise and absorb capital.
