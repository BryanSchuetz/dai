Secure property rights are a key to economic growth. Equitable access to land is the basis for pro-poor and socially inclusive economic growth, while competition for land often inflames tensions between different groups, resulting in conflict. In the context of climate change and population growth, with greater pressure on scarce resources, secure and equitable access to land is becoming increasingly important. As a result, the international development community is escalating its support for land-related programs around the world.

DAI works across all types of tenure systems—[customary](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/customary-land-tenure/?utm_source=daidotcom), private, and public—to strengthen the security and rights of land users by focusing on the reforms and capacity building that are appropriate in each context. We do so in cost-effective ways, working with and through familiar local institutions that have won the confidence of local people. We ensure that processes are community-driven and paired with effective capacity building at the institutional level. Deploying proven program management framework, we take an integrated approach that brings together:

* Locally tailored interventions building on local practices and experience.
* Pilot testing of innovative practices, which then allow for larger roll-out programs.
* A commitment to ensure that the poor, women, and marginalized groups are included in every aspect of the program.

Our land tenure and property rights work includes securing property rights, policy and legal reforms and regularization, cadaster development, land record rehabilitation and management, land information systems, institution building and information dissemination, participatory land use and resource planning, dispute resolution and mitigation, training, research and communications, and grants management.

DAI holds an indefinite quantity contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development—[Strengthening Tenure and Resource Rights (STARR)](http://usaidlandtenure.net/))—through which DAI and specialist partners provide land tenure and property rights services to USAID and its government, private sector, and nonprofit partners around the world. DAI tenure specialists carry out cutting-edge research on the impacts of tenure interventions on economic development, equity, and social stability. We are also a leading provider of land services to the U.K. Department for International Development, with a successful portfolio of work in Africa and the Caribbean.
