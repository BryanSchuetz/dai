We help community, business, and government partners translate climate science and global climate models into downscaled, locally viable strategies and solutions. We work with local and national governments and the private sector to develop programs and policies that will improve resilience to climate impacts, mitigate behaviors that exacerbate vulnerabilities, and protect freshwater supplies, forests, food security, and economic development.

DAI also recognizes that developing countries’ growth—often fueled by the conversion of forests for agriculture expansion and the exploitation of forests for needed foreign exchange—can confound adaptation and contribute to climate change. We strive to end the conflict between advancing development and [mitigating climate change](https://www.facebook.com/DAIGlobal/videos/10155131037990797/) through our diverse portfolio of climate change and economic growth services. To support clients’ efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage low-emission development, our specialists work with national and local governments, communities, and private companies to:

* Assess mitigation and adaptation options.
* Craft plans and undertake actions to improve the management of forests, water, and coastal resources.
* Embed climate resilience strategies within critical sectors, including agriculture, health, infrastructure, and governance.
* Develop clean energy resources and improve energy efficiency.
* Establish greenhouse gas accounting and monitoring systems.
* Capitalize on carbon markets to create economic incentives based on sound resource management.
