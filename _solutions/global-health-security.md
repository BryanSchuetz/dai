As COVID-19 has demonstrated, disease outbreaks can overwhelm global health and economic systems, throwing populations into chaos and uncertainty. 

Within 18 months from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 4 million people died and millions more were hospitalised or facing long-term health consequences from catching the virus.

          <p><a href="our-work/projects/indonesia-fleming-fund">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</a> is a growing global health threat with many calling it the next, silent pandemic. Through the Fleming Fund, DAI strengthens AMR surveillance across Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. DAI has supported or set up One Health governance systems in each country, increasing coordination across multiple ministries and stakeholders, improving AMR data use, and strengthening public health animal and human health laboratories. The program has supported more than 70 laboratories across the target countries, training and educating staff in advanced microbiology, developing laboratory protocols and systems, refurbishing buildings, and installing new equipment. </p>

          <p><strong>Preparedness & Response</strong></p>
          <p>Improving global health security requires countries to better prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats such as avian influenza, Ebola, or MERS. DAI implemented <a href="/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr">USAID’s Preparedness and Response</a> project, which supported 16 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia to tackle public health threats by establishing or strengthening national One Health platforms and supporting preparedness and response planning. The project also prepared and responded to six outbreaks. Seven countries developed resource mobilization plans to request government financial resources, and six countries conducted preparedness and response simulations. One Health coordination and health security responses were strengthened, increasing resilience to emerging diseases.</p>

While the pandemic’s economic impact is yet to be fully understood, estimates from the Ebola and SARS epidemics suggest the world lost near $100 billion in productivity, meaning COVID-19’s impact will be much greater. These crises have demonstrated the importance of pandemic preparedness, disease surveillance, and immunizations to safeguard our neighbourhoods and communities.

Our health security practice imagines a world where governments can act quickly to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats. One where countries work together, developing consensus and partnership across different ministries and neighbour states. And one where scientists and health workers have the resources and knowledge to provide the very best vaccines, medicines, and healthcare for their citizens. 

## We specialise in preventing, detecting, and responding to health threats.


**Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure:** We develop governance structures, strengthen human resources, and deliver commodities and consumables to support public health laboratories and infectious disease units. 

**Health Security Strategy Development & Costing:** We help governments prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats by developing national health security plans, national action plans and accompanying budgets. 

**Pandemic Preparedness & Emergency Management:** The threat of antimicrobial resistance, emerging diseases and zoonotic pathogens continues to increase. We support governments to prepare for pandemics and public health emergencies by developing and implementing strategies, training and equipping the public health workforce, and improving emergency management systems.

**Policy Development:** Strong policies come together with the right data, the right people and good communication. We translate hard surveillance data and scientific research into bespoke policy recommendations and conduct political economy analyses to identify the right people to put recommendations into action. 

**Institutionalising One Health:** Ensuring national health, animal and environmental ministries work together to develop the best public health policies, means developing strong multisectoral coalitions and partnerships. We build networks within national governments to improve collaboration, information sharing and positive public health action.
