We help communities, nations, and regions address food insecurity by championing solutions that lead to resilient and sustainable livelihoods, including increasing agricultural productivity and production, expanding opportunities to increase and diversify incomes, and promoting socially and economically responsible safety nets.

We build a ladder between subsistence-level family farming and small-scale commercial agriculture. We also work to remove policy constraints that, while well-intentioned, tend to exacerbate rather than alleviate food shortages, especially during a crisis.
