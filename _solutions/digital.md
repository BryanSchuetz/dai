We combine our 40-plus years of experience in global development with the latest and most relevant information and communication technology (ICT) tools. We do more than just introduce innovations on a project-by-project basis—we help build the institutions and sustainable processes that facilitate innovation on the ground.


Over the last 10 years, DAI has been at the forefront of innovation, fusing ICT and geospatial elements into more than 50 global development projects. Technology is a dynamic tool that has the potential to amplify the voices of people in developing countries. Whether using mobile phone applications, geospatial maps or crowdsourcing tools, technology provides the ability for individuals, groups, and societies to better organize, gain access, participate, empower, communicate, report, learn, and be accountable. By building on existing capacity and what works, along with introducing new tools and techniques, DAI has succeeded in establishing sustainable ICT initiatives.

**Mobiles for Development**—Building off existing local communication practices, adapting to environmental constraints, and creating teams of experts that bring a wealth of experience and knowledge of global best practices, we deliver mobile solutions that meet local development needs.

**Monitoring and Evaluation**—Using mobile devices for data collection—ranging from collection of baseline monitoring and evaluation data to citizen polling—represents a potential shift in the timeliness and accuracy of data for development decisions.

**Geospatial Services**—DAI is at the forefront of utilizing spatial planning and data visualization as a tool in development programs. We frame our approach around designing and presenting solutions that visually link the spatial relationship between dozens of variables, enabling practitioners to practice data-driven decision making in complex programs.

**Collaboration and Communities**—Going beyond traditional knowledge management, DAI has implemented strategies to engage communities of solvers around seemingly intractable development challenges, we have cultivated communities of natural resource practitioners using new social media such as videos, blogs, wikis, and gamification initiatives.
