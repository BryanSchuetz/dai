DAI Capital builds on DAI’s global platform, strong local partnerships, and in-depth market knowledge to act as a conduit for commercial capital. DAI’s brand and reputation position us as a credible financial intermediary in emerging and frontier markets, while our technical expertise allows us to manage risk effectively and add value to promising businesses that are constrained by capacity and capital.

DAI’s heritage as an economic development firm, including extensive engagement with development finance institutions, makes us an ideal partner for private sector institutions seeking investment opportunities that are profitable, responsible, and sustainable across frontier and emerging markets.

Our team has deep professional experience in corporate finance, investment banking, private equity, venture capital, and venture building.

## DAI Capital operates across two pillars:

### Capital Advisory

In November 2020, DAI concluded a  [majority investment](/news/dai-magister-the-leading-capital-advisor-and-investment-bank-for-international-and-emerging-markets) in Magister Advisors to form [DAI Magister](https://www.daimagister.com/), a strategic partnership enabling DAI to directly connect businesses in emerging and frontier markets with equity investors through Magister’s advisory business. DAI Magister advises businesses on raising capital from local and international investors:

* Developing tailored capital structures that balance the short- and long-term capital needs of their business
* Structuring, negotiating, and executing transactions to raise capital
* Preparing businesses and assets for investment from local and international investors
* Identifying suitable financial and strategic investors from a range of private and public institutions 
* Addressing other strategic issues, such as corporate governance and risk mitigation

Further, we advise asset managers and other investors seeking to deploy capital in frontier and emerging markets. We advise them in identifying investment opportunities, executing investments, and exiting their investments.

### Asset Management

DAI’s longstanding local presence and extensive networks across frontier and emerging markets provide an ideal platform for identifying promising investment opportunities, performing due diligence on these investment opportunities, and providing management support for the investee management teams once an investment is made.

In December 2021, DAI announced the [acquisition of MicroVest Capital Management](/news/dai-acquires-international-asset-management-firm-microvest), adding a rich vein of expertise to DAI’s existing asset management team, connecting that combined team to a wider network of investors, and providing DAI a platform on which to build a world class asset management business.

<!-- ### Ventures

We invest directly in early-stage companies and create greenfield businesses in frontier and emerging markets where the DAI platform provides a strategic advantage—particularly in financial services, agriculture, health, technology, and government services.

DAI Capital’s existing portfolio includes several healthcare assets—[THINKMD](/news/dai-invests-in-thinkmds-clinical-assessment-technology), [ClickMedix](/news/dai-global-health-invests-in-mhealth-leader-clickmedix), and [MobileODT](/news/dai-invests-in-mobileodt-a-breakthrough-provider-of-cervical-cancer-detection-tech)—as well as greenfield startups at an earlier stage. -->
