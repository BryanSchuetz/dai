DAI Capital builds on DAI's global platform, strong local partnerships, and in-depth market knowledge to act as a conduit for commercial capital. DAI’s sterling brand and reputation enable us to serve as credible financial intermediaries in emerging and frontier markets, while our technical expertise allows us to manage risk effectively and add value to promising but constrained businesses. 

Our team has deep professional experience in corporate finance, investment banking, private equity, venture capital, and venture building.
 
## DAI Capital operates across three pillars:

### Advisory 

We advise businesses in frontier and emerging markets to access finance from global capital markets. As sell-side advisors, we work closely with clients across industries to prepare their business for investment, develop tailored capital structures, place investments with hand-picked investors, and close transactions promptly. 
 
We also advise asset managers and other investors to identify and execute investments in our target markets.

### Asset Management
 
We design, build, and manage investment funds to invest in frontier and emerging markets across asset classes and sectors.
 
DAI’s longstanding local presence and extensive networks in our markets provide early insight and an ideal platform on which to identify and execute promising commercial investments.
 
### Ventures 
 
We invest in early-stage companies and create greenfield businesses in frontier and emerging markets where the DAI platform provides a strategic advantage or cross-selling opportunities—particularly in financial services, agriculture, health, technology, and government services.
 
DAI Capital’s existing portfolio includes several healthcare assets—THINKMD, ClickMedix, and MobileODT—as well as greenfield startups at an earlier stage.
