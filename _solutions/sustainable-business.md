# Full Life-Cycle Advisory and Project Implementation Services that Advance the Global Sustainability Agenda

DAI's Sustainable Business Group works across industries including manufacturing, energy and renewables, mining, retail, apparel, food and beverage, financial services, philanthropy, and telecommunications.

Whether weâ€™re helping a multinational safely re-open garment factories during the pandemic or helping a financial institution design a climate finance program, our work is guided by 50 years of development experience around the world. 

We rely on data-rich technical analysis and on-the-ground relationships to structure successful service engagements and investments in developed and emerging markets, with an unwavering commitment to our clients and the countries where they work.

## Helping businesses achieve their ESG commitments 

The new frontier of what it means to be a responsible business requires companies to drive meaningful impact and local prosperity in the communities and environments where they operate.

We believe the private sector can meet this challenge and deliver growth by developing inclusive supply chains, fit-for-purpose corporate social investments, and data-driven strategy and program design. 

We help our clients move beyond regulatory compliance to position themselves as leaders in responsible business.

## Supporting corporations to optimize and localize their supply chains

Our work in supply chains applies state-of-art data collection and analysis to enhance business decision making and ensure inclusive growth outcomes.

Our approach delivers comprehensive programs of business upskilling and workforce training that ensure large-scale investments have the infrastructure for long-term sustainable operations and maintenance.
