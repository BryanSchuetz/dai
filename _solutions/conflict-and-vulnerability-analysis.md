We analyze the factors—across all sectors—that generate conflict and map the interplay among power brokers, civil society, and the private sector. We examine the potential drivers of instability such as the proliferation of small arms, human trafficking, land tenure issues, competition for natural resources, and unequal access to political power. We analyze the trajectory of a transition and the internal and external stresses. We seek to understand the level of institutional capacity, accountability, and inclusion, and how key stakeholders can build confidence and transform institutions. We identify disincentives to stability and potential spoilers.

We translate this analysis into solutions through participatory planning and community decision-making tools that help local partners prioritize needs and solve problems. We propose pragmatic options, rather than conventional best-practice solutions that may not suit local dynamics. We consider the long-term impact that short-term activities may have on state-building and development prospects, balancing the need to deliver visible benefits with the need to lay the foundation for durable peace.
