We engage citizens, communities, governments, and private organizations to expand access to sustainable health care. We are leaders in the development of innovative and sustainable financing approaches to expand individual and household access to health services and products, including clean water.

At the service delivery level, we equip the private health care providers who provide the vast majority of health services to poor communities with the business skills, financial credit, and other resources they need to sustain small practices and ensure they have access to the credit they need to upgrade and expand their services.

Sustainability demands accountability. We help build relationships between civil society and government, and create opportunities for continued communication through, for example, citizen-monitoring of government-provided services across sectors, including health. We provide rural communities with practical tools that enable them to hold local government health providers accountable while strengthening the overall public financial management structures needed to ensure performance in the health sector.
