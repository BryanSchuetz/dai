# DAI Capital Australia
We draw on decades of experience in investment mobilization and international development to prepare and raise finance for infrastructure projects in the healthcare, water, circular economy and renewable energy sectors, primarily in Indigenous Australia and the Asia region.

DAI Capital Australia works closely with project sponsors and various stakeholders to develop projects that provide strong financial returns and significant social and environmental impact. We employ blended finance approaches to attract private investment by reducing early-stage capital risks and addressing funding imbalances, thereby promoting sustainable and impactful outcomes.

## Our Expertise

### Origination and Project Preparation

We work hand-in-hand with project sponsors and our extensive networks—i of industry experts, development finance institutions, EPC+F providers, local and international governments, multilateral institutions, and non-government development agencies, and engineering, procurement, construction, and finance (EPC+F) providers—to identify and prepare healthcare, renewable energy, circular economy, and water assets that deliver the highest level of financial return and social and environmental benefit. This work includes feasibility studies, financial modelling and structuring, environmental and other regulatory approvals, and the development of investor/lender collateral.

### Capital Raising

DAI Capital specializes in capital raising for infrastructure and development projects, playing a pivotal role in bridging the funding gap for critical sectors such as healthcare, renewable energy, and Indigenous economic development in Australia, as well as other regions in Asia and beyond. Our comprehensive financial services encompass corporate finance, project finance, and innovative blended finance solutions, among others.

We use blended finance to help unlock the estimated $70 trillion in investment required to develop desperately needed healthcare, renewable energy, and other infrastructure in Asia and beyond. We focus on attracting public finance to the early project preparation/ and pre-financial close stages of asset development—the part of the project cycle where it is hardest to attract private investment, yet where investment in infrastructure is most impactful. We then work alongside and raise capital from private co-investors and government finance institutions to bring qualified projects to financial close. 

### M&A Advisory Services

We have wide-ranging expertise in mergers and acquisitions, offering customized solutions for each unique transaction. Our process covers everything from identifying opportunities to finalizing deals, with a focus on both financial and strategic value.
