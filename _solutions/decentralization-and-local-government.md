In many developing countries, key resources for public service delivery are controlled entirely in the capital, where life is often starkly different from that in the provinces, and where the voices of constituents may be faint. We work with local governments to build the capacity for responsive, effective service delivery, so that decisions on resource allocation can be made where services are provided and constituents can demand accountability for service quality. We promote policies that ensure equitable distribution of national resources to regional and local governments. We strengthen transfer policy, revenue and expenditure assignments, capital budgeting, fiscal responsibility, and public procurement.
