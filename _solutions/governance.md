DAI’s Governance Sector strengthens accountability and improves government performance by providing technical advice, strategic guidance, and support to public institutions, elected bodies, and citizens. Based on a thorough understanding of the incentives, interests, and political economy inherent to policy development and implementation, we supply tailored solutions to policy makers, citizen leaders, and elected representatives. Our approach to governance seeks to identify and foster engagement between citizens and their government, recognizing that both the supply and demand for good governance is necessary to initiate change. In doing so, we empower leaders, recognizing that locally led solutions have the greatest potential for sustainability.

[Local Governance and Decentralization](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/decentralization-and-local-government)—We work with national, regional, and local governments to transfer central authority to government bodies that are closer and more responsive to the needs of citizens.

[Public Financial Management and Domestic Revenue Mobilization](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/public-financial-management)—We help countries improve public financial management and advance thought leadership on approaches to overcoming policy and institutional constraints to economic competitiveness, socioeconomic development, and poverty reduction. Our assistance includes helping them boost domestically generated tax revenue, maximize the efficiency and transparency of public spending, and partner with the private sector to stimulate investment and inclusive growth.

[Anti-corruption, Transparency, and Accountability](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/voice-and-accountability)—We build the mechanisms necessary to hold government institutions accountable and increase citizen voices in decision-making.

[Justice, Citizen Security, and Rule of Law](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/law-and-justice)—We strengthen the rule of law by building citizens’ ability to demand better governance through oversight mechanisms, civic education, civil society strengthening, and legal support.

[Institutions Building and Policy Reform](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/institutional-and-policy-reform)—We help stakeholders improve the legal and regulatory environment, and build the capacity of government agencies in financial management, public service provision, local economic development, and public outreach.

[Public Administration and Civil Society Strengthening](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/public-administration-civil-service-reform-and-human-resources)—We develop the human capacity of the civil service while strengthening the ability of the central government to perform essential functions and deliver services in a transparent and equitable manner.

[Legislative Strengthening](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/legislative-strengthening)—We advise legislative bodies on institutional reform and help them involve constituents and other important stakeholders in the policy process for better, more responsive representation.
