Over one third of people around the world don’t have access to basic, affordable healthcare and governments are unable to single-handedly meet the needs of their population. Significant untapped potential to deliver health products, services and information exists within the private sector Business can be one the world’s greatest drivers of positive impact, as demonstrated by the explosion of social enterprises and impact investors emerging daily around the world. But in many countries, economic, financial, and regulatory barriers prevent new companies and business from developing or applying their health care solutions.

          <p><strong>Jalin</strong></p>
          <p>Each year, thousands of women still die from childbirth and pregnancy complications in Indonesia. USAID’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-jalin">Jalin project</a> aimed to reduce maternal and newborn mortality by developing 26 co-created and context-specific interventions to boost antenatal and birthing care. Jalin worked closely with a variety of stakeholders in national and sub-national government entities, the private sector, and healthcare providers to develop 26 local solutions. Solutions included a floating ambulance service or free counselling and information on accessing antenatal care for women at supermarkets. A partnership with a U.S. fashion company also helped expand maternal and newborn health in the workplace in selected factories. The program supported more than 5,600 women to give birth, resuscitated 170 newborns who were not breathing at birth, and provided nearly 3,700 infants with postnatal care. </p>

          <p><strong>Promote: Women in the Economy (WIE)</strong></p>
          <p>For decades, women in Afghanistan have faced severe gender inequities, including exclusion from the workforce and limited access to maternal healthcare. To foster gender equality and women’s participation in the workplace, USAID’s WIE project supported Afghan women with industry specific business skills. The project supported 25 home-based midwife hubs to teach women basic business skills, ensuring their midwifery was sustainable. WIE also partnered with the Afghanistan Medical Council to officially accredit female doctors and dentists, who were previously unlicensed.</p>

Stronger relationships between public and private entities and engagement with other industries such as transportation, agriculture, and education, are needed to provide the world’s most vulnerable with access to equitable healthcare. Our Market Solutions practice develops new partnerships, investments, and programs to enable companies and health services to grow. We envision quality healthcare becoming a driver of economic growth and community wellness by supporting governments and civil society to leverage private sector actors and market dynamics.
