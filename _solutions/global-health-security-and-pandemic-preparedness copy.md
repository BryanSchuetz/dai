We coordinate responses across sectors for a holistic approach to emerging infectious diseases and disease management. 

A strong response starts with capacity building for governments, communities, universities, and regional professional networks.

Environmental changes, as well as economic and technological advancements, have changed how we interact with each other and our world, allowing infectious diseases to spread around the world at a much faster pace. As new diseases and disease variants capture headlines, we are increasingly aware of the risks created by the growing interconnectedness of the global health landscape.

Most emerging infectious diseases are transmitted to people by animals. Understanding these interactions allows us to [better prepare](https://soundcloud.com/csis-57169780/frontline-perspectives-on-pandemic-preparedness) for, monitor, and respond to diseases. We address these challenges at multiple levels, facilitating coordinated responses across sectors for a holistic approach to disease management and strengthening health systems resilience.

We apply a One Health approach linking animal, human and environmental health specialists to address zoonotic disease and other emerging health threats, including antimicrobial resistance.

A strong response starts with building the capacity of governments, communities, universities, and regional professional networks. For example, work with government partners to strengthen the national systems, policies and practices needed to formalize and institutionalize One Health. We also we build training curricula and instructional quality into programs for first-responders, support regional university-led One Health networks to strengthen public health epidemiology systems, and form cadres of public health professionals to address outbreaks. Communities and countries can most effectively mitigate the impact and spread of disease by collaborating across sectors to strengthen preparedness, surveillance, and response efforts in tandem.

DAI has implemented more than $250 million of global health security projects since 2006, including programs to address avian influenza, ebola, MERS, and diseases of unknown origin.
