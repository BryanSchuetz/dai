Across the developing world, population growth and increasing demand for agricultural land has put tremendous pressure on natural resources as people strive to meet their daily food, shelter, and energy requirements. Many countries face increasing pressure from communities and local and international entrepreneurs to sacrifice their natural resources to support economic growth. Over the course of 40 years developing innovative solutions to complex environmental problems, DAI has shown that growth and conservation are not mutually exclusive. Promoting broad participation, advocacy, and accountability as the pathway to better-managed natural resources, our specialists partner with local governments and communities to develop and implement the enabling policy and legislative frameworks required to devolve management authority and resource-use rights of the forest, fisheries, and wildlife sectors. Combining local knowledge and the findings of environmental impact assessments, we help to raise awareness of land-use activities that compromise the ecosystem and biodiversity. Building on this heightened environmental awareness among stakeholders, we employ training and incentives to redirect development into sustainable channels.
