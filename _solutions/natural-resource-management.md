Across the developing world, population growth and surging demand for agricultural land has put tremendous pressure on natural resources as people strive to meet their daily needs for food, shelter, and energy. Many governments face increasing pressure from communities and local and international businesses to exploit natural resources in the quest for economic growth. But DAI’s experience has shown that growth and conservation are not mutually exclusive—in fact, linking the two can have significant, mutually reinforcing benefits.

Promoting broad participation, advocacy, and accountability as the pathway to better-managed natural resources, our specialists partner with local governments and communities to develop and implement the enabling policy and legislative frameworks required to devolve management authority and resource-use rights of the forest, fisheries, and wildlife sectors. Combining local knowledge and the findings of environmental impact assessments, we help to raise awareness of land-use activities that compromise the ecosystem and biodiversity. Building on this heightened environmental awareness among stakeholders, we employ training and incentives to redirect development into sustainable channels.

In parallel, we work with national governments, communities, and conservation organizations to improve the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation at a landscape level, safeguarding emblematic and precious ecosystems and species whose existence is a fundamental cornerstone of a broader sustainable landscape. Our contributions include technical assistance in sustainable financing, improving the systems and mechanisms for scientific research and the formulation of conservation strategies, and improving the effectiveness of protected area and ecosystem management.
