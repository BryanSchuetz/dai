**Innovating global health solutions to save lives.** 

Our global health team and its regional and local partners have the technical skills and local knowledge to deliver comprehensive health solutions while responding to issues ranging from emerging pandemic threats to HIV/AIDS to waterborne diseases. Our approach leverages nonhealth resources in DAI’s environment, economic growth, governance, and post-conflict stabilization sectors to save lives and achieve health improvements all over the world. In June 2017, DAI joined forces with [Health Partners International (HPI)](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk), adding a wealth of expertise in health systems strengthening. HPI, which has delivered more than 200 health projects in 40 countries over the past two decades, offers particular strengths in immunization, nutrition, malaria and other communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, and maternal, newborn, and child health.

[Emerging Infectious Diseases](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/emerging-infectious-diseases)—We coordinate responses across sectors for a holistic approach to disease management. A strong response starts with capacity building for governments, communities, universities, and regional professional networks.

[Health and Livelihoods](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/health-and-livelihoods)—Our global health and livelihoods work spans all sectors and engages families, community leaders, nongovernmental groups, schools, governments, health and agriculture workers, and the private sector to foster resilience, expand economic opportunity, and improve health outcomes.

[Nutrition and Food Security](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/nutrition-and-food-security)—We build bridges between nutrition, agriculture, and food security. We are at the forefront of improving nutrition and food security outcomes through our integrated agriculture, agribusiness, and livelihoods programs.

[Sustainable and Accountable Health Services](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/sustainable-and-accountable-health)—We develop innovative and sustainable financing approaches to expand individual and household access to health services and products, including clean water.

[Health Governance](/our-work/solutions/governance-solutions/health-governance)—We help countries advance health outcomes through improved accountability, resource allocation, policy development, and administration of health services.
