We envision better health systems that foster quality & access; reduce threats; and promote healthier behaviors to improve lives globally.

The health of our communities and our planet has never been more important. The recent growth of melting glaciers, rising seas, migration, conflict, and global epidemics and pandemics have put the health of our globe into sharp focus. Our world needs better health security, better access to healthcare, a deeper understanding of how our natural world and physical health interact, and greater engagement with the market forces that shape our global economy.

That’s why we are passionate about Global Health. We are on a mission to shape a more liveable world and we have more than 50 years of experience in doing just that. We specialize in improving health security and systems, health equity, and private sector engagement using our diverse expertise and unique ways of working.

## We Bring a Multi-Sector Perspective

The health problems we tackle are complex—entwined with climate, governance, business, and financial issues that mean solutions need to work for systems—not silos. Our multidisciplinary expertise means when we design health programs we sit with bankers, scientists, statisticians, and politicians to develop smart strategies and projects that work for the long haul.

[Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/global-health-security-and-pandemic-preparedness)—We coordinate responses across sectors for a holistic approach to emerging infectious diseases and disease management. A strong response starts with capacity building for governments, communities, universities, and regional professional networks.

**Health Systems Strengthening**—We unlock governance, financial, and market potential to tackle health systems failures, improve accountability, and expand equitable access to high-quality health services and products in support of universal health coverage. 

We work across high-priority health areas including reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health; nutrition; clean water; malaria; neglected tropical diseases; and other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. 

We build bridges between the agriculture, nutrition, and food security sectors, engaging community leaders, nongovernmental groups, governments, and the private sector to foster resilience, expand economic opportunity, and improve health outcomes through our integrated agriculture, agribusiness, and livelihoods programs.

**Digital Health Solutions**—We specialize in electronic health information systems (eHIS) and the use of information for strategic decision making, especially in emerging markets and fragile states.

We work with governments to develop interoperability between eHIS and other public health informatics systems, including PEPFAR Data for Accountability, Transparency, and Impact Monitoring (DATIM), and Laboratory Information Systems. Our health informatics experience spans DHIS2, SmartCare, OpenMRS, CommCare, MESI, and IQCare.

We build on strategic partnerships with—and investments in—a range of next-generation health technology innovators that lie along the health value chain, including ClickMedix, MobileODT, and ThinkMD. Our future lies in creating the “connective tissue” that knits together disparate tools in  a fully integrated system that spans from the individual patient all the way up and across the national health system.
