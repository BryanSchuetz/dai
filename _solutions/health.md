DAI leverages what we have learned in other sectors since 1970, providing technical assistance to hundreds of long-term development projects worldwide in agriculture, environment, economic growth, governance, and post-conflict stabilization, and applies it to global health.

With more than 20 years of health experience, we apply a proven ‘whole-of-systems’ approach to strengthen health systems, global health security, and digital health to take solutions to scale and achieve impact.

DAI Global Health’s capacity was augmented by the June 2017 acquisition of [Health Partners International (HPI)](http://healthpartners-int.co.uk/), adding a wealth of technical ‘know-how’ in health systems strengthening. HPI delivered more than 200 health projects in 40 countries over the past two decades in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health including immunization, nutrition, malaria, and other communicable diseases.

## Doing Development Differently

In September 2017, DAI and [IntraHealth International](https://www.intrahealth.org/) joined forces to amplify development impact. IntraHealth is a nonprofit with notable expertise in health workforce development, digital innovation, and reproductive, maternal, and child health, including HIV/AIDS. IntraHealth is now a strategic affiliate of DAI Global Health. United, we offer a broad spectrum of integrated, holistic services to address the evolving global health and development challenges of the 21st century, with an emphasis on people-centered, tech-enabled, and data-centric solutions focused primarily on the poor and underserved. 

[Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness ](/our-work/solutions/health-solutions/global-health-security-and-pandemic-preparedness)—We coordinate responses across sectors for a holistic approach to emerging infectious diseases and disease management. A strong response starts with capacity building for governments, communities, universities, and regional professional networks.

**Health systems strengthening**—We unlock governance, financial, and market potential to tackle health systems failures, improve accountability, and resource allocation to expand equitable access to quality health services and products in support of universal health coverage. 

We work across priority health areas including reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health; nutrition; clean water; malaria; neglected tropical diseases; and other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. 

We build bridges between agriculture, nutrition, and food security sectors, engaging community leaders, nongovernmental groups, governments, and the private sector to foster resilience, expand economic opportunity, and improve health outcomes through our integrated agriculture, agribusiness, and livelihoods programs.

**Digital health solutions**—We specialize in electronic health information systems (eHIS) and the use of strategic information for decision-making in emerging markets and fragile states.

We work with governments to develop interoperability between eHIS and other public health informatics systems, including PEPFAR Data for Accountability, Transparency, and Impact Monitoring (DATIM), and Laboratory Information Systems. Our health informatics experience spans DHIS2, SmartCare, OpenMRS, CommCare, MESI, and IQCare.

Building on strategic partnerships with and investments in a range of next-generation health technology innovators that lie along the health value chain– including ClickMedix, MobileODT, Laboratoria, and ThinkMD. Our future involves creating the “connective tissue” that allows disparate tools to come together into a fully integrated system that spans from the patient all the way up and across the national health system.
