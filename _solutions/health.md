The health of our communities and our planet has never been more important. The recent growth of melting glaciers, rising seas, migration, conflict, and global epidemics and pandemics have put the health of our globe into sharp focus. Our world needs better health security, better access to healthcare, a deeper understanding of how our natural world and physical health interact and greater engagement with the market forces that shape our global economy.   

That’s why we are passionate about Global Health. We are on a mission to shape a more liveable world and we have over 50 years’ experience in doing just that. We specialise in improving health security and systems, health equity and private sector engagement using our diverse expertise and unique ways of working.

## We Bring a Multi-sector Perspective 

The health problems we tackle are complex – entwined with climate, governance, business, and financial issues that mean solutions need to work for systems – not silos. Our multidisciplinary expertise means when we design health programmes we sit with bankers, scientists, statisticians, and politicians to develop smart strategies and projects that work for the long-haul.      

## We Think & Work Politically 

Getting government buy-in and support for development projects requires an understanding of the politics, incentives, and agendas of policymakers. We conduct political economy analyses to help us design solutions that reach across the aisle.

## We Integrate Digital Technology 

Technology helps us to work smarter, not harder, to achieve the best results. Across all our projects, we look for opportunities to incorporate digital technology for programme management, data analysis and health services. 

## We Act as a Broker

Our global network and experience mean we understand that different actors bring different strengths and solutions – and that systemic changes in health need inputs from local and international partners. We act as a convener, bringing together the best ideas across disciplines, civil society, government, and the private sector to broker innovative and impactful solutions.

<!-- ### Health Security

**Equipping governments around the world to respond to epidemics and health emergencies**

As COVID-19 has demonstrated, disease outbreaks can overwhelm global health and economic systems, throwing populations into chaos and uncertainty. Within 18 months from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 4 million people died and millions more were hospitalised or facing long-term health consequences from catching the virus. While the pandemic’s economic impact is yet to be fully understood, estimates from the Ebola and SARS epidemics suggest the world lost near $100 billion in productivity, meaning COVID-19’s impact will be much greater. These crises have demonstrated the importance of pandemic preparedness, disease surveillance, and immunizations to safeguard our neighbourhoods and communities.

### Health Governance

**Developing fairer, better health systems through strong processes and meaningful partnerships**

The health governance team supports international Universal Health Coverage goals: where individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.   
Around the world, the most stretched health systems face the biggest challenges in creating efficient and equitable healthcare. Globally 80% of people live in low-and middle-income states, but only 20% of global health expenditure is spent in these countries. Over-stretched health systems face additional governance challenges such as poor financial controls, limited accountability mechanisms and weak partnerships with the private sector. Health information is often recorded on paper and data systems for tracking outbreaks and conducting surveillance are often fragmented.

### Market Solutions

**Harnessing market dynamics to improve health systems and access to affordable, sustainable health services and products**

Over one third of people around the world don’t have access to basic, affordable healthcare and governments are unable to single-handedly meet the needs of their population. Significant untapped potential to deliver health products, services and information exists within the private sector Business can be one the world’s greatest drivers of positive impact, as demonstrated by the explosion of social enterprises and impact investors emerging daily around the world. But in many countries, economic, financial, and regulatory barriers prevent new companies and business from developing or applying their health care solutions.

### Health Equity

**Tackling inequalities in social determinants to improve health**

Social or economic status can potentially have a greater influence on a person’s health than the availability of healthcare. Access to clean water, social support, education, income, food security and housing dramatically affect our level of exposure and resilience to threats and diseases, our health-related behaviours, and our ability to access health services. There is an unfair and unavoidable difference in health status between rich and poor countries. Globally, the lower the socioeconomic position of a country, the worse the health of its citizens. In fact, social determinants are estimated to account for 30-55% of an individual’s health status. These inequalities in social determinants however also exist within countries and it is the poorest and most vulnerable that are worse affected.
