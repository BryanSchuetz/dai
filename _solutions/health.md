We envision better health systems that foster quality & access; reduce threats; and promote healthier behaviors to improve lives globally.

The health of our communities and our planet has never been more important. The recent growth of melting glaciers, rising seas, migration, conflict, and global epidemics and pandemics have put the health of our globe into sharp focus. Our world needs better health security, better access to healthcare, a deeper understanding of how our natural world and physical health interact, and greater engagement with the market forces that shape our global economy.

That’s why we are passionate about Global Health. We are on a mission to shape a more liveable world and we have more than 50 years of experience in doing just that. We specialize in improving health security and systems, health equity, and private sector engagement using our diverse expertise and unique ways of working.

## We Bring a Multi-Sector Perspective

The health problems we tackle are complex—entwined with climate, governance, business, and financial issues that mean solutions need to work for systems—not silos. Our multidisciplinary expertise means when we design health programs we sit with bankers, scientists, statisticians, and politicians to develop smart strategies and projects that work for the long haul.

## We Think and Work Politically 

Getting government buy-in and support for development projects requires an understanding of the politics, incentives, and agendas of policymakers. We conduct political economy analyses to help us design solutions that reach across the aisle.

## We Integrate Digital Technology Technology

Technology helps us to work smarter, not harder, to achieve the best results. Across all our projects, we look for opportunities to incorporate digital technology for program management, data analysis, and health services.

## We Act as a Broker 

Our global network and experience mean we understand that different actors bring different strengths and solutions—and that systemic changes in health need inputs from local and international partners. We act as a convener, bringing together the best ideas across disciplines, civil society, government, and the private sector to broker innovative and impactful solutions.

### Our Practice Areas

**Health Security**—As COVID-19 has demonstrated, disease outbreaks can overwhelm global health and economic systems, throwing populations into chaos and uncertainty.

Within 18 months from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 4 million people died and millions more were hospitalized or facing long-term health consequences from catching the virus. While the pandemic’s economic impact is yet to be fully understood, estimates from the Ebola and SARS epidemics suggest the world lost nearly $100 billion in productivity, meaning COVID-19’s impact will be much greater. These crises have demonstrated the importance of pandemic preparedness, disease surveillance, and immunizations to safeguard our neighborhoods and communities.

Our health security practice imagines a world where governments can act quickly to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats. One where countries work together, developing consensus and partnership across different ministries and neighboring states. And one where scientists and health workers have the resources and knowledge to provide the very best vaccines, medicines, and healthcare for their citizens.

**Health Governance**—The health governance team supports international Universal Health Coverage goals—where individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.

Around the world, the most stretched health systems face the biggest challenges in creating efficient and equitable healthcare. Globally 80 percent of people live in low- and middle-income states, but only 20 percent of global health expenditure is spent in these countries. Over-stretched health systems face additional governance challenges such as poor financial controls, limited accountability mechanisms, and weak partnerships with the private sector. Health information is often recorded on paper and data systems for tracking outbreaks and conducting surveillance are often fragmented. 

Strong partnerships and systems are the answer to many of these issues. We adopt a non-hierarchical, partnership approach with public sector and civil society to develop health systems that deliver quality services fairly. We start with inclusive stakeholder mapping and political economy analysis to understand the incentives, opportunities and barriers to change. We then use this data to help make systems more transparent, efficient and effective. 






We build on strategic partnerships with—and investments in—a range of next-generation health technology innovators that lie along the health value chain, including ClickMedix, MobileODT, and ThinkMD. Our future lies in creating the “connective tissue” that knits together disparate tools in a fully integrated system that spans from the individual patient all the way up and across the national health system.
