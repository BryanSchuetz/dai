We establish partnerships with government, civil society, and private sector actors to provide short-term stability and build the foundation for long-term development. Building on our diverse experience and nuanced understanding of conflict dynamics in crisis environments, our work in crisis mitigation and stability has won DAI a global reputation for sure-footed and innovative post-crisis assistance.

[Conflict and Vulnerability Analysis](/our-work/solutions/stability-solutions/conflict-and-vulnerability-analysis)—We examine historical and structural factors that lead to conflict and map relations between power brokers, civil society, and the private sector. We identify the root causes of conflict and assess the impact of cross-sector issues—such as terrorism, trafficking, small-arms proliferation, and the unequal access of vulnerable groups to political power and natural resources—on sustainable peace.

[Transition and Stabilization Programming](/our-work/solutions/stability-solutions/transition-and-stabilization-programing)—At critical moments in a country’s transition process, we facilitate the sustainable rebuilding of communities by their own members. We identify key individuals and groups committed to peaceful, participatory reform; strengthen locally driven violence mitigation efforts; and provide economic recovery opportunities to stricken communities.

[Peace-building and State-building](/our-work/solutions/stability-solutions/peace-building-and-state-building)—Our approach focuses on the long-term goal of building legitimate indigenous governments that are better able to respond to the needs of their populations. We analyze root causes of conflict, map power relations, improve local capacity to articulate demands to the state, and strengthen state institutions’ capacity to deliver those important services.

[Security and Justice](/our-work/solutions/fragile-states-solutions/security-and-justice)—We support access to, accountability in, and the stability of formal and informal justice institutions, building the capacity of legitimate security and justice systems to deliver services and ensure citizen security. We emphasize grassroots, community-level collaboration as the starting point for reform, particularly in complex transitional justice and post-conflict environments..
