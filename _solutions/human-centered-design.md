Digital tools fall short of expectations when they are designed for users, rather than with them. CDA understands that collaboration with the user and local partners is essential to designing sustainable and scalable digital tools. Combined with the results of our Frontier Insights research, we employ a human-centered design process to understand the needs, behavior, and sentiments of end-users. Through an iterative design approach, we help clients create digital tools that are data-driven, flexible, and built for sustainability across emerging markets.
