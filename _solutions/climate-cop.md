      <p>Local authorities are uniquely positioned to identify the climate change adaptation responses that best meet local needs. Furthermore, they typically have the mandate to undertake the small- to medium-sized adaptation investments needed to build climate resilience. Yet they frequently lack the resources to do so, especially in a way aligned with established decision-making processes and public planning and budgeting cycles. </p>
      <p>The EU cooperates with its Southern neighbors to support their green transition and help the region adapt to climate impacts. The EU also supports local authorities and their affiliation with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) initiative through its Mediterranean branch, the <a href="https://www.com-med.org/en/">Covenant of Mayors Mediterranean</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.climamed.eu/">Clima-Med</a> project is implemented by a DAI-led consortium. Speakers at the event will include the Clima-Med Team Leader, Mr. Naguib Amin and Mr. Georges Youssef, Mayor of Menjez, Lebanon.
