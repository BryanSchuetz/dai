Fundamental to any model of good governance are strong, fair, enforceable laws and their just and equitable application to all citizens. Our law and justice practice helps build this framework in the countries where we work by strengthening formal judicial institutions and expanding access to justice by working with nonformal dispute resolution regimes. We increase the capacity of legislators, police, prosecutors, judges, court administrative staff, lawyers, and nonstate justice officials to build legal frameworks, and institutions, and to operate within established laws and regulations.
