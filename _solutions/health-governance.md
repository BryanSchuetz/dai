DAI’s work in health governance spans national, local, and clinical service delivery levels. At national levels, we work on policy to improve public financial management and accountability, as well as help countries prepare for emerging pandemic threats like Ebola. At local levels, we work with civil society and governments to improve allocation of resources, accountability, and service delivery. We help clinical and community service providers incorporate livelihoods issues in their screening protocols and service delivery, thereby improving care—particularly for people living with HIV.
