The global financial crisis of 2007 left in its wake a population of frustrated and discouraged young people pushed out of traditional economic, political, and social pathways. Without access to steady jobs due to the economic downturn, on top of limited access to quality and relevant educational opportunities, youth around the world including in the Middle East, Central America, and North Africa reacted in powerful and noticeable ways.

DAI has responded to the call to action on youth employment. For more than 45 years, DAI has integrated the needs of the next generation into its programs by putting young people at the forefront of our initiatives. Leveraging private sector, foreign governments, and donor investment in areas such as agriculture, health, governance, and technology, DAI programs strive to create strong economic, social, and political systems so that young people can navigate their local communities and environments to empower themselves professionally, economically, and personally. DAI achieves this through programs in workforce development and entrepreneurship, education, health, leadership, and life skills.
