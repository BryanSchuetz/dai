In emerging markets, high-level statistics on the local digital sector are often neither current nor targeted enough to guide programming. CDA helps bridge this knowledge gap for our clients, by employing *Frontier Insights*, a proprietary research method that identifies usersâ€™ technology preferences, financial capacity, infrastructure access, and information collection habits.

In addition to this research, our experts also conduct market research and ecosystem analysis.
