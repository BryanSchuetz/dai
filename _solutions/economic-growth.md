Our economic growth work brings together the right mix of industry dynamics to unleash broad and inclusive growth. Focusing on commercial sustainability, and building on the fundamental belief that small businesses and farmers play vital roles in the value chains at the heart of developing economies, we work to improve domestic and global market access, forge links between companies, enhance workforce productivity, expand access to finance, and boost local value. Our programs seek to leave behind adaptive commercial systems that provide ordinary citizens with concrete opportunities to build better lives for themselves, their communities, and their nations. As incomes rise, so do the structures—and the courage—to demand accountability from government officials, especially in the development of predictable, internationally competitive business environments. 

[Market Systems and Value Chain](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/value-chain-and-market-systems-development)—We are a global leader in implementing [market systems development](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/market-systems-development-a-primer-on-pro-poor-programming) programs, expanding the frontiers for driving competitive, inclusive, and resilient growth. We have been at the forefront of integrating the value chain approach and the Making Markets Work for the Poor approach (M4P) within the broader systemic thinking.

[Agriculture and Food Security](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/agriculture-and-food-security)—We address food insecurity by championing sustainable solutions that lead to resilient and sustainable livelihoods.

[Finance and Investment](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/finance-and-investment)—We develop innovative, technology-driven finance and investment solutions that accelerate farming, enterprise, and industry expansion.

[Business Environment Reform](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/business-environment-reform)—We have long been a leader in reforming business environments, which improves the competitiveness of countries, industries, and companies in domestic and global markets.

[Trade](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/trade)—We work with countries and businesses to increase their participation in local, regional, and international markets.

[Innovation and Entrepreneurship](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/innovation-and-entrepreneurship)—We were a pioneer in developing and implementing innovative startup, small, and medium enterprises and private sector growth strategies for national and international competitiveness.

[Workforce Development and Youth](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/workforce-development-and-youth)—The global financial crisis of 2007 left in its wake a population of young people pushed out of traditional economic, political, and social pathways. Without steady jobs, on top of limited access to quality educational opportunities, youth around the world reacted in powerful and noticeable ways.

[Gender](/our-work/solutions/economic-growth-solutions/gender)—DAI integrates gender equity and women’s empowerment programming across all our services: design, research, monitoring and evaluation, assessments, and implementation, as well as through our staffing.
