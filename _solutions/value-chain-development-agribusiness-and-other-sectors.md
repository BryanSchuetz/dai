From input suppliers to end retailers, we strengthen the capabilities of all actors along a product line to meet market demand by alleviating constraints on productivity and growth, increasing access to high-quality inputs and working capital, and improving information flow.

We facilitate strategic planning—rigorously diagnosing opportunities and constraints, and recommending best-practice approaches by those with an interest in seeing growth in the entire chain—which increases domestic production, boosts sales, improves incomes, promotes investment in the rural economy, and generates new jobs in sectors with natural, and sometimes thoughtfully nurtured, comparative advantages.

Under our model, buyers, suppliers, and financial service providers become the leading, sustainable source of technical assistance, and value-chain participants become advocates for legal and regulatory reform when needed.
