Our approach to enhancing security and justice focuses on the effectiveness, accountability, and responsiveness of security and justice institutions such as the police and the judiciary. We develop links among institutions, citizens, and communities. 

According equal importance to national and local issues, we work simultaneously on institutional reform and improved service delivery. We help citizens identify gaps in security and justice provision. We mobilize their participation in reform efforts and strengthen channels to advance their demands for improved services. We help national governments and donors improve systems to measure results. 

Transparency enhances accountability and enables evidence-based decision making. Our programs seek to strengthen ties between the formal and informal sectors, improve respect for human rights, and promote full access to justice, with special recognition of the needs of women and girls.

We recognize there are trade-offs between immediate needs and long-term reform. We seek to balance this tension through programs with shorter- and longer-term horizons. We also understand the tension between stabilization and development activities, yet recognize that both are important to produce resilient societies and governments that will reduce poverty and foster economic growth.
