Addressing social and environmental challenges in developing countries is a tough job for any single organization. As a recognized leader in developing and managing successful public-private partnerships, we help our clients establish partnerships that directly support their own business and social responsibility challenges.

Our public-private partnerships services include:

* Clarifying your partnership needs and business and social strategy goals to formulate a strategy for partnership.
* Guiding the identification of potential partners, negotiations, and all other aspects of the relationship.
* Sourcing and evaluating potential partners by tapping our networks in local governments, the donor community, and international and local nongovernmental organizations; developing governance, policies, operating mechanisms, and performance management mechanisms.
* Providing training, evaluation, and other tools to strengthen the capacity of new or existing partners.
