* Guiding the identification of potential partners, negotiations, and all other aspects of the relationship.
* Sourcing and evaluating potential partners by tapping our networks in local governments, the donor community, and international and local nongovernmental organizations; developing governance, policies, operating mechanisms, and performance management mechanisms.
* Providing training, evaluation, and other tools to strengthen the capacity of new or existing partners.
