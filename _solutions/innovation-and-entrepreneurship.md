A pioneer of developing and implementing strategies for national competitiveness, DAI now works at the forefront of development strategies around low-carbon growth.

We work across all sectors—from rural agricultural to large-scale manufacturing and service industries—to boost firm-level innovation and productivity and develop ecosystems that foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and employment generation. We take a commercial approach to stimulating production efficiency and quality improvements, through new technologies and improved workforce skills. We work with companies to adopt innovative business models, reach high-value markets, leverage investments, and access new technologies.

We engage all stakeholders—policymakers, private sector, training institution, and business service providers—to generate partnerships that offer entrepreneurship and employment opportunities, particularly for youth.
