DAI Magister is a leading investment bank that specializes in advising international technology and climate companies, with a particular focus on strategic sell-side mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and growth financings. The firm offers comprehensive financial advisory services for transactions across diverse sectors, including climate tech, B2B SaaS, fintech, deep tech, and healthcare tech. DAI Magister’s expertise spans Europe, the United States, Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and other emerging markets.
