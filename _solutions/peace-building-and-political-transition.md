Peace-building and political transition are fundamentally “endogenous” processes, meaning that local people will drive the ultimate outcome. As an external partner, we help them succeed by enhancing broad participation in the transition, providing financial and technical assistance, and promoting best-fit approaches.

Because constructive state-society relations are critical to building legitimate states that deliver for their citizens and promote long-term peace, we support solutions that empower the state, when appropriate, and encourage state-society relations. We work with local partners to achieve five interrelated objectives that strengthen state-society relations:

* Addressing the root causes of violent conflict
* Supporting local conflict management mechanisms
* Promoting inclusive political processes
* Improving the core functions of responsible states
* Responding to public expectations and needs

Our work depends upon the level of fragility that prevails within the state and its institutions—ranging from corruption and deteriorating governance to ongoing violent conflict, post-conflict or political transition, and gradual improvement. We analyze the factors—across all sectors—that generate conflict and map the interplay among power brokers, civil society, and the private sector. We examine the potential drivers of instability such as the proliferation of small arms, human trafficking, land tenure issues, competition for natural resources, and unequal access to political power. We analyze the trajectory of a transition and the internal and external stresses. We seek to understand the level of institutional capacity, accountability, and inclusion, and how key stakeholders can build confidence and transform institutions. We identify disincentives to stability and potential spoilers.

We then translate this analysis into solutions through participatory planning and community decision-making tools that help local partners prioritize needs and solve problems. We propose pragmatic options, rather than conventional best-practice solutions that may not suit local dynamics. We consider the long-term impact that short-term activities may have on state-building and development prospects, balancing the need to deliver visible benefits with the need to lay the foundation for durable peace.
