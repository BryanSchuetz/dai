By tailoring financial products and services to the needs of the [low-income market segment](http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/financial-inclusion/), small and medium-sized enterprises, and high-priority sectors such as agriculture, our financial services specialists develop innovative, [technology-driven solutions](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/benefits-of-bringing-mobile-banking-to-the-unbanked/) that accelerate enterprise and industry expansion.

We also structure international funds that address broader development challenges with longer-term financing requirements such as water resources management, energy efficiency, infrastructure, and utility upgrading. And, we excel at turning around loss-making state-owned banks by expanding services, attracting customers, and vastly increasing profitability and market share.
