We work with countries and businesses to increase trade in local, regional, and international markets. Whether facilitating accession to the World Trade Organization, assisting in regional trade negotiations, advising and implementing policy reforms, expanding market access, promoting trade, or helping clients meet the requirements to enter markets, our economic growth specialists have worked with policy makers and enterprises to provide them with the needed analysis, skills, and implementation support.

Our global footprint enhances our ability to make global market linkages and our expertise in public-private collaboration provides the foundation on which we have helped a wide range of sectors and businesses—including small women-owned businesses—to access world markets and large suppliers. Expertise in development and corporate social responsibility allows us to bridge the corporate and development worlds and ensure that the benefits of trade accrue at all levels.
