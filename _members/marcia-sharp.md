Marcia is currently the lead consultant for LearnPhilanthropy, a collaborative effort of foundations and philanthropy support organizations to develop an online resource hub for learning and professional development for grantmakers. She led the team that developed Communications as Engagement: The Millennium Report to the Rockefeller Foundation in the mid-1990s, one of the first works to call attention in the nonprofit world to the coming power of communications for connection and knowledge sharing, in addition to its more traditional use for “publicity.” She was the lead consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation’s Communication and Social Change initiative, which worked to define a new role for communications to support economic and social development in the third world. She led the study team and was co-author of Voices for Change, Reasons for Hope, the report from the Annenberg Institute for School Reform summarizing a nationwide mapping of the role of public engagement in school reform. A graduate of Harvard University, Marcia has been a member of the Advisory Board for the Center for Effective Philanthropy and the Kellogg Foundation’s College of Consultants, and has served as a research fellow at the Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California.
