In the 1990s, Niels was a key member of the team that created the Danish Technological Institute (DTI)—an industrial research and development and technology consulting company—through a sequence of mergers and acquisitions, and took the company through a significant turnaround toward its current status as one of the larger and more profitable companies in its sector in Europe. He was the Chairman of 2M Invest A/S from 1995 until its successful initial public offering in 2000. Niels was also behind the creation of the Danish government’s Learning Lab.
