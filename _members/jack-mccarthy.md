Jack McCarthy has 20 years of international experience in the research, design, implementation, management, and evaluation of international development programs, especially those involving crisis prevention, mitigation, and responses. Earlier in his career, McCarthy focused on developing USAID’s initial programmatic efforts in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union. He subsequently served as program manager for USAID’s primary program supporting Mozambique’s successful transition from war to peace, including the demobilization, reinsertion and (social and economic) reintegration of former combatants, extensive de-mining, and reconstruction efforts. Jack led USAID’s comprehensive program supporting the implementation of the Guatemalan Peace Accords. USAID’s “Peace Program” was a comprehensive and multifaceted effort with emphasis on war-affected regions and populations, including victims of the conflict as well as former combatants. The $120 million program included a range of projects supporting national reconciliation; capacity building; economic growth; and improved national and local level governance to enhance stability and build sustainable peace.

In addition to long-term assignments in Africa, Central and South America, Jack has, on behalf of USAID, U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the United Nations and other international organizations, provided high-level technical assistance, management and design support, assessments and analyses regarding key components of post-conflict or transitional programs in more than two dozen other conflict-prone countries. Jack also serves as a faculty member for George Mason University’s Graduate School of Public Policy, where he teaches courses on conflict, security, and development dynamics in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
